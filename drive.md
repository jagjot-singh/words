#Driving from Delhi 
I'm trying to negotiate comfort between my forehead and vibrations from the window of the speeding SUV, trying to find some pressure that works for all the forces involved. Flying through my tinted vantage point are things I see briefly, sounds and smells which I catch in waves, and places and faces that even when not entirely familiar themselves, still manage to take part in some slowly settling familiarity. 

All that I am seeing, smelling, hearing, and taking in is seeping into me, into some mysterious and not entirely comfortable place. I suppose it is that same place which is now sending up waves of emotion, some of which catch me off guard. With every kilometer the car gains towards Punjab, the severity of this phenomenon is turned up a notch. 

Every few kilometers the track changes but the sound, the rhythm, drums, especially the dhol drum, remains familiar. It all sounds like Bhangra. 

We are escaping Delhi now--leaving the sprawls of Delhi always feels like an escape from something--and the unmistakable smog and  smells begin to dminish but not disappear. I find myself anticpating the part of the trip where we enter the green farmlands of rural Punjab, and the pollution and smog begin to seem far away, as if in some other country, in some other atmosphere perhaps. At some, hopefully not in my lifetime, it will have to be acknowledged that  pollution does not acknowledge state boundaries, especially not in a country which boasts fourteen of the thiry most polluted cities on Earth. But for now I long for the green of that childhood reprieve, however fragile and wishful it may be. 

An old Manak track--remixed to emphasize the bass at the expense of his voice--comes on. That voice, so faint but so familiar, begins stirring up memories, expertly weaving, blurring, and meshing them with my current sensory input, to a slow and steady bass rhythm. The scene playing in mind is of water shooting out the end of a steel barrel, powered by the precise **put - put -put -put -put -put'*s of a neaby diesel motor whose fuel fills my nostrils. The sensation of stabbing my hands into that stream of water, my own naiive astonishment at having them shoved so coldly back out, fills my heart. Somewhere nearby there was a radio playing; at least that is how I remember it now.

Next track, back to the present. More conscious of my role now, that of a mere observer of tidal movements in an endless sea of emotion, I try to stay afloat it all.

 I press my head a bit more forcefully against the glass. 

Breathe, I tell myself, just breathe.

Perhaps the next roadside sight, the very next kilometer even, will present something to ease me.

The state of Haryana. Or Haryana state. I try to notice a difference in it between now and then, then being the last time I passed through it, but everything looks just like I remember it to be then. 

A sign announces that we are driving into Sonipat. 

Still in the outskirts of Sonipat, we pass by juice vendor. The sight of him, his skin polished an impeccable black by a life lived at the sun's mercy, is remarkably contrasted against the bare light-brown earth spanning around him. He is leaning against his shadeless mechanical contraption; dusty rubber tires, faded green frame that must at some past point in time have been the green of thick short grass, large gears protruding at odd angles, and a couple of glasses leaning against a plastic jug. All around lies discarded pulp, some days old by the look of it. A typical set-up for selling freshly squeezed sugarcane juice, in the middle of somewhere, for no one in particular. 

This man leans on his set-up neither in expectation nor in dismissal, but with a casual air of acceptance, a signature of time experienced doing a thing over and over. 

How many people per day stop here?  Does this man remain hopeful during days that challenge hope? He must, I decide. How else could one do this day after day? I decide to make request for a stop at the next sugacane juice vendor. 

More signs come and then go, exiting my field of vision just as I finish reading them. 

Just loud enough to heal myself over a particularily enthusaistic track, I read out loud the names on singns flying by, curious how they sound on my tongue. 

*Panipat.* 

*Paaa - niii - patt* ! 

I repeat with appropriate emphasis when my ennunciation feels off. My rolling R's need to roll better, for a bit longer, I realize. As do my N's. Both sounds are important in forming punjabi words.

I note with amusement how some of the sounds I am making would be comical those whom the passing signs represent. Years of speaking, hearing, absorbing English and English-influenced sound, have basterdized my tongue, which betrays me now.

 It will soon come around, I know. Like it did the last time this thing happened, which was almost four years ago now. And like it did the time before that. A reflex.

A few minutes later the vehicle has to slow slightly as a disfigured dog is in the middle of the road, crossing it casually, about twenty meters ahead. It seems to be in no rush. I wonder if it has been struck by a vehicle at some point in it's life. So many strays get hit by motorists and don't seem to develop any sort of apprehension towards them. It hops as it walks, a swinging hind leg doing most of the movement, while the front two limbs pull synchronised. If not for the short mysterious stump of matted fur in place of the fourth limb, the illusion that this three-legged, slowly hopping but still strangely smooth-moving scavenger is typical of it's species would be close to complete. Dogs do this so well, I think;  they accept circumstance and adapt to new roles with a non-chalence that only the most remarkable humans can muster. 


Two more hours pass on the road, and a flow of pleasantly dull glowing lightbulbs begins to work it's way into the sightgs. At one such point, where several colorful lightbulbs greet us, we stop to eat. The dhaba we are eating at looks to me like all the other dhabas we've passed in Haryana. But this one is familiar to Amrit, my father's longtime friend and trusted driver. 

After the meal we are enjoying some sweet chai as Tejji, my father's business partner, teases Amrit incessantly about the condition of his chosen dhaba, where even the geckos lack such manners that they feel no shame in being seen during dinner time. Amrit remains mostly silent, but being an oppotunistic and mischevious man, he cannot resist the odd retort here and there, usually alluding exagerratedly to Tejji's usage of opiates. 

His swift remarks get support via laughter from my father, and on ocassioon, he surprises me enough for a snicker to sneak past my fatigue as well. He perks up when I react this way, raises his eyebrows, gloating and winking. I can tell the trio have had a lot of practice at this game of incessant verbal one-upmanship, probably their prefered form of entertainment during long drives. Without taking a side, my father seems to enjoy small victories by both sides.

This scene, unfloding live in front me, reminds me of another one I had seen through a short video sent to m leane via WhatsApp by my brother, a few months back. 

Th recording featured of the three of them, in their typical neatly-ironed dress clothing, standing at the edge of a green feild which yeilds some indiscernable short crop. My father is holding a sleek looking airplane, about shoulder-width wide against his six-foot frame. He looks confused and keeps readjusting his grip on the plane. Meanwhile Amrti and Teji are something akin to wrestling each other, both partly holding but evidently wanting to wrench away full control over an awkward, large remote control, a long antenna flailing about wildly as the two men tug and yell. 

The scene is one of total disarray and disorder, a severe lack of planning and context refecting on the facial expressions. The effect is amplified further by slight shaking of the shooter's hands, presumably my brother either laughing or trying to restrain laughter. It appears as if they just suddenly happened to come about this remote controlled plane in the middle of farmland, and still haven't recovered from an intial disbelief, and pure delight and enthusiasm to fly the thing are only now setting in. 

Suddenly my father seems satisfied with his hold on the thing, and gives a shout to signal as such to Amrit and Tejji, without even looking at them. He brings his plane hand back to his ear as if preparing for a shot-put throw, as Teji and Amrit simultanaeously decide to hold one end of the remote as they anticipate the great launch which will the test their control. 

My father shouts again, pulling his arm back even more, takes a measured step back, then stepping forward again, launches the plane.

The flight lasts about a second, crashing and disappearing completely into the greenness no more than five yards out. Almost immediately after leaving my fathers hand, the plane had taken a sharp nose dive and gracefully exited a suspensful situation. Arms get thrown up in disbelief, curses fly. 
 
At the dinner table now, I am not yet feeling accustomed enough to have anything meaninful to add to the conversation flowing over chaa. I try to follow the slang and deliberately subtle word play, but my focus is repeatedly interrupted by yawns. The flight was over twenty hours, and the realization that the sweet chaa is not even perking me up adds a mark of authenticity to my fatigue. 

Soon we are back on the road and entering the state of Punjab. We are passing through Patiala when my head begins to roll back towards the headrest of it's own accord. I drift in and out of not quite sleep but not quite an awake state. Beside me, to my right, my father has found a way to stretch out his limbs comfortably by angling himself at probably a practised angle. He is asleep. Seeing him I feel encouraged to pursue sleep myself. 

I close my eyes. I feel thankful that my earlier emotional turbulence, having threatened to protrude out at times, now seems at rest somewhere deep inside. For now, I need not prod nor bother it, nor it me. 

Just as my eyes touch rest in a closed state, the vehicle swerves sharply to the right and then swings back hard to the left. I snap wide-awake out of what I suddenly realize was a dream-like state. Before my eyes are even fully open, my hands have found the seat in front of me, occupied by Tejji, and I find myself correcting my balance. 

Tejji's arm reaches out and slaps Amrit something between playfully and punitively on the back of the head, immediately follow by excited words which are inaudible to me over the aprupt and agressive blaring horn of a large white SUV overtaking us recklessly from the right. 

My focus darts quickly between the passing vehicle and Amrit, who is visibly tense and tilting his head at the vehicle, while throwing up a plam towards it. The other car continues to express irritation through incessant honking, and the mood in the vehicle is becoming tense. Almost as if he had been anticipating this, Amrit suddenly slams the brakes, and had he not done so the other vehicle would have rammed into us. It ends up cutting us off instead, before correcting it's trajectory.

Now the surprise has worn off, and anger is starting to settle in. Shouts are being hurled at Amirt to speed up and get beside the vehicle by both Tejji and my father. Amrit's half-hearted explanation of how he had made the initial mistake by cutting off the other vehicle,  is barely even heard by my father, whose temper is now switched on, and he continues shouting at Amrit to speed up. Tejji, suprisingly calm suddenly, is trying an alternative approach by patting Amrit's back, cajoling him to speed up just so we may see the driver, as if hoping to an old friend. 

Overwhelmed and outnumberd, head shaking slowly, Amrit starts to accelerate. The vehicle in front, taking notice of our decided approach, begins swerving wildely side to side. The unmistakable showboating nature of this action finally tips me towards anger, and I am suddenly aware of my heart beating as I allow tension and anger to begin working their way up from my torso. 

I do not wish to join the already volatile anger flaring around me, and decide to start curbing my reponse to the situation. 

Breathe, I tell myself, just breathe, as Amrit finds an opening, and pulls right into a space the other car had just been seemingly bracing to swerve into. 

Windows are rolled down now, and we finally get a look at the driver, a Sardaar. In the back I can see several women, and I breifly make out the top of a child's head, sheltered between some arms. The driver does not roll down his window, but is communicative via hostile gestures. Tejji is now leaning across and is nearly in Amrit's lap, who simply looks embarassed, and still in the polilte guy role, appears to be coaxing the man to roll down his window. I can barely hear his voice though, my father, even though he is leaning mostly out of his window, gesturing widly with an arm, has launched into an explosive tirade of that I think is probably loud enough to be heard through the other cars's closed window. 

Knowing his temper, the dreadful and surreal knowledge, that this situation is nowhere near any kind of de-escalation, starts to sink in. 

We continue driving like this for a few minutes. Sproadically shouting, cursing, ocassionlly having to swerve around other vehicles, but with Amrit's determination always ending up abreast of the other vehicle, the driver window of which remains irritably rolled up. I am wishing, hoping desperately, that he will just roll it down, so everyone may exchange insults and the vehicles can speed off their seperate ways, but both cars seem to be making an effort now at maintaining a spiteful closeness. My hope is dwarfed by the knowledge of how naaive it is. 

 I can see him talking animatedly into a cellphone now, his gestures becoming less wild and more confident. I try to see the other passengers, their reactions, but they seem as rigidly still as statues, their faces tucked away from both us and the man driving them, rocking only involuntarily with the slight rocking of the vehicle. 

My hands, always quick to concede anger, are clenched now.  I see him nodding exagerratedly in our direction now, which is driving my father to learn even further out the window in an attempt to reach out and smack the other vehicle. 

The scenario is becoming clear now. He likely lives in the area, and he has called--sucessfully, judging from his satisfied threatning nods--for backup. 
 
 My father, having suddnely reoccupied his seat, instructs Amrit to fall back now. He then tells Amrit to tail him whereever he goes. 
 
 From the tone in which he says this, I sense that he has not giving up, and his set on consumating anger. At the same time I am taken slightly aback by his sudden change in demeanour. He seems quiet yet relaxed, disinterested yet not undetermined. 
 
 I try throwing some words at him, as a feeler to get hints about his emotional state. I try humour, try to paint the situation as not a big deal, try adressing it as a thing of the past. 
 
 I cap off my attempt by asking him how far we are from home now. No reactions. His attention is elsewhere. 
 
 He suddenly reassuringly puts a hand on my back. I want to believe in the gentility of the gesture, but instead I search for anger lurking in the silence. He playfully slaps my back a couple of times before speaking.
 
  
 *Koi Gal Ni, Putt. Darn di lod nahi*.
 
 ( Don't worry, *putt*. No need to be afraid.) 
 
It is that one word. *Putt*. I know too well how varying with context the meaning of endearing words coming out of my father's mouth can be. And I find myself now trying to put this situation into some familiar context.  It feels strange trying to find in my memory something similiar to this. I am still trying to parase all this, trying to decide how to feel about it, as he leans past me into the front of the car. 

His hand reaches for the armrest between Tejji and Amrit.  I had not noticed it before, but that middle compartment is odd. It seems larger than it should be. 
 
He starts peeling it open, slowly, the way he peels back decorative layers from sacred texts. 

My head turns away before whatever rests in that dark cavity is revealed to me.

I do not want to see it. 

 I already know. By not looking I am only prolonging confirmation. The way beneath the suddenly dear warmth of blankets, one prolongues exposing the body to a cold in the room of which they are becoming aware.
 
 The cold does not hide nor sneak up on us though. It is always there, out where we dare not venture. It is just. 
  
My head falls back, I let it, let it bounce off the headrest a couple of times. 

My hands rise up seemingly of their own accord to touch my forehead, as if unsure of where else to rest. 

This too is familiar. This sense of being in a place which I can never be prepared for. All I can do is let things play out, though that is even crediting myself too much, for things here play out regardless of whether I let them or not. 
 
For a moment, for one still moment inside that vehicle driving casually into certain violence, perhaps only as a last-ditch desperate effort to escape a growing sense of disconcertment, I let myself wonder:  am I dreaming all this and am about to wake up, or am I really experiencing this scenario? 

Just breathe, I remind myself.
