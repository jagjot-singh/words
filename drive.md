#Driving from Delhi 
I'm trying to negotiate comfort between my forehead and vibrations from the window of the speeding SUV, trying to find some pressure that works for all the forces involved. Flying through my tinted vantage point are sights, sounds, smells, places, and faces that even when not entirely familiar, are still somehow part of a slowly settling familiarity. 

All that I am seeing, smelling, hearing, take in, is seeping into me, into some mysterious and not entirely comfortable place. I suppose it is that same place which is now sending up waves of emotion, some of which catch me off guard. With every kilometer the car gains towards Punjab, the severity of this phenomenon is turned up a notch.
We are escaping Delhi now--leaving the sprawls of Delhi always feels like an escape from something--and the unmistakable smog and  smells begin to baseline, not diminish, but reach steady predictable levels one can become familiar with. 

I am uncomfortable taking it all in. An helpless observer of tidal movement in a sea of emotion. I press my head a bit more forcefully against the glass. 

Breathe, I tell myself, just breathe.

Perhaps the next roadside sight, the very next kilometer even, will present something to ease me.
 
I continue playing tug of war, me against my self, while signs, names of places mostly snag my focus now and again. Some are very familiar, others strangely alien. 

The state of Haryana. Or Haryana state. I try to notice a difference in it between now and then, then being the last time I passed through it, and to my eyes everything looks to be in the same state now as it was then. 

We are driving into Sonipat, a sign announces. 

On the outskirts of Soinpat, the sight of a vendor hits me. His seemingly polished skin, an impeccable black, the signature of a life lived at the sun's mercy, is contrasted remarkably by the bare light-brown earth around him. He is leaning against his shadeless mechanical contraption; dusty rubber tires, the frame a fading green that must at one time have been the healthy green of thick grass, large gears protrude at odd angles, and a couple of glasses lean against a plastic jug. All this set up to fresh-squeeze sugarcane juice, in the middle of nowhere, for no one in particular. He leans on his set-up neither in expectation nor dismissal, but perhaps with the casual air of acceptance that comes only with time and experience. 

How many people per day stop here?  Does this man remain hopeful during days that challenge hope? He must, I decide. How else could one do this day after day? I decide to make request for a stop at the next sugacane juice vendor. 

More signs come and then go, exiting my field of vision just as I finish reading them. 

Just loud enough to heal myself over the bhangra music playing in the car, I read the names loud, seeing how they sound on my tongue. 

*Panipat.* 

*Paaa - niii - patt* ! 

I repeat with appropriate emphasis where my ennunciation feels off. My rolling R's need to roll better, for a bit longer, I realize. As do my N's. Both typically used in forming punjabi words.

I note some of the sounds I am making would be comical those whom the passing signs represent. Years of speaking, hearing, absorbing English and English-influenced sound, have basterdized my tongue, which betrays me now.

 It will soon come around, I know. Like it did the last time this thing happened, which was almost four years ago now. And like it did the time before that.

A few minutes later the vehicle has to slow slightly as a disfigured dog is in the middle of casually crossing the road, about twenty meters ahead. It seems to be in no rush. I wonder if it has been struck by a vehicle at some point in it's life. So many strays get hit by motorists and don't seem to develop any sort of apprehension towards them. It hops as it walks, a single hind leg doing most of the movement, while the front two pull in sync. If not for the short mysterious stump of matted fur in place of the fourth limb, the illusion that this three-legged, slowly hopping but still strangely smooth-moving scavenging animal is typical of it's species would be close to complete. Dogs do this so well, I think;  they accept circumstance and adapt to new roles with a non-chalence that only the most remarkable humans can muster. 


Two hours later, we stop to eat. The dhaba we are eating at looks to me like all the other dhabas we've passed in Haryana. But this one is familiar to Amrit, my father's longtime friend  trusted driver. 

After the meal we are enjoying some sweet chai as Tejji, my father's business partner, teases Amrit incessantly about the condition of 'his' dhaba, where even the geckos lack such manners that they feel no shame in being seen. Amrit remains mostly silent, but being an oppotunistic and mischevious man, he cannot resist the odd retort here and there, usually alluding exagerratedly to Tejji's usage of opiates. His swift remarks get support by laughter from my father, and on ocassioon, he surprises me enough for a snicker to escape me as well. He perks up at this, raises his eyebrows, gloating and winking. I can tell the trio have had a lot of practice at this game of incessant verbal one-upmanship, probably their prefered form of entertainment during long drives. My father, without taking a side, manages through laughter to enjoy small victories by both sides.

This scene, unfloding live in front me, reminds me of another one I had seen in a short video sent to me via WhatsApp by my brother, a few months back. 

Th recording featured of the three of them, in their typical dress clothes, standing at the edge of a green feild yeilding a short thick crop. My father is holding a sleek looking airplane, about shoulder width wide against his six foot frame. He looks confused and keeps readjusting his grip on the plane. Meanwhile Amrti and Teji are wrestling each other, both partly holding but evidently wanting to wrench away full control of an awkward, large remote control, it's long antenna flailing about dangerously as the two men tug at it with considerable effort. 

The scene is one of total disarray and disorder, the lack of planning and context refected by the facial expressions. The effect is amplified further by slight shaking of the shooter's hands, presumably due to laughter. It appears as if they just came about the plane completely and unexpectedly by chance, and still haven't fully gotten over an intial disbelief, as pure delight and enthusiasm to fly the thing set in. 

Suddenly my father seems satisfied with his hold on the plane, and gives a shout to signal as such to Amrit and Tejji, without looking at them. He brings his plane hand back to his ear as if preparing for a shot put throw, while Teji and Amrit make the frantic decision to hold one end of the remote as they wait in anticipation. 

My father shouts again, pulling his arm back even more, takes a measured step back, and launches the plane.

The flight lasts about a second, crashing and disappearing into the field no more than five yards out as almost immediately after leaving my fathers hand, the plane takes a sharp nose dive. Arms get thrown up in disbelief, curses fly. 
 
I am not yet feeling accustomed enough to have anything meaninful to add to the conversation now happening over cha. I try to follow the flow of slang and deliberately subtle word play, but my focus is repeatedly interrupted by yawns. The flight was over twenty hours, and the realization that the sweet chaa is not even perking me up adds a mark of authenticity to my fatigue. 

Soon we are back on the road and enter Punjab. We are passing through Patiala when my head begins to roll back towards the headrest of it's own accord. I drift in and out of not quite sleep but not quite awake. Beside me, to my right, my father has found a way to stretch out his limbs comfortably by angling himself, and is asleep. Seeing this I feel encouraged to pursue sleep myself. I close my eyes and feel thankful that my earlier emotional turbulence, having threatened to protrude out, now seems at rest somewhere deep inside. For now, I need not prod or bother it, nor it me. 

Just as my eyes settle into a closed state, the vehicle swerves sharply to the right and then swings back again to the left. I snap wide-awake out of what I suddenly realize was a dream-like state. Before my eyes are even fully open, my hands have found the seat in front of me, occupied by Tejji, and I find myself correcting my balance. 

Tejji's arm reaches out and slaps Amrit something between playfully and punitively on the back of the head, immediately follow by excited words which are inaudible to me over the aprupt and agressive blaring horn of a large white SUV overtaking us recklessly from the right. 

My focus darts quickly between the passing vehicle and Amrit, who is visibly tense and tilting his head at the vehicle, while throwing up a plam towards it. The other car continues to express irritation through incessant honking, and the mood in the vehicle is becoming tense. Almost as if he had been anticipating this, Amrit suddenly slams the brakes, and had he not done so the other vehicle would have rammed into us. It ends up cutting us off instead, before correcting it's trajectory.

Now the surprise has worn off, and anger is starting to settle in. Shouts are being hurled at Amirt to speed up and get beside the vehicle by both Tejji and my father. Amrit's half-hearted explanation of how he had made the initial mistake by cutting off the other vehicle,  is barely even heard by my father, whose temper is now switched on, and he continues shouting at Amrit to speed up. Tejji, suprisingly calm suddenly, is trying an alternative approach by patting Amrit's back, cajoling him to speed up just so we may see the driver, as if hoping to an old friend. 

Overwhelmed and outnumberd, head shaking slowly, Amrit starts to accelerate. The vehicle in front, taking notice of our decided approach, begins swerving wildely side to side. The unmistakable showboating nature of this action finally tips me towards anger, and I am suddenly aware of my heart beating as I allow tension and anger to begin working their way up from my torso. 

I do not wish to join the already volatile anger flaring around me, and decide to start curbing my reponse to the situation. 

Breathe, I tell myself, just breathe, as Amrit finds an opening, and pulls right into a space the other car had just been seemingly bracing to swerve into. 

Windows are rolled down now, and we finally get a look at the driver, a Sardaar. In the back I can see several women, and I breifly make out the top of a child's head, sheltered between some arms. The driver does not roll down his window, but is communicative via hostile gestures. Tejji is now leaning across and is nearly in Amrit's lap, who simply looks embarassed, and still in the polilte guy role, appears to be coaxing the man to roll down his window. I can barely hear his voice though, my father, even though he is leaning mostly out of his window, gesturing widly with an arm, has launched into an explosive tirade of that I think is probably loud enough to be heard through the other cars's closed window. 

Knowing his temper, having been raised by it, a dreadful and surreal knowledge, that this situation is nowhere near any kind of de-escalation, starts to sink in. 

We continue driving like this for a few minutes. Sproadically shouting, cursing, ocassionlly having to swerve around other vehicles, but with Amrit's determination always ending up abreast of the other vehicle, the driver window of which remains irritably rolled up. I am wishing, hoping desperately, that he will just roll it down, so everyone may exchange insults and the vehicles can speed off their seperate ways, but both cars seem to be making an effort now at maintaining a spiteful closeness. My hope is dwarfed by the knowledge of how naaive it is. 

 I can see him talking animatedly into a cellphone now, his gestures becoming less wild and more confident. I try to see the other passengers, their reactions, but they seem as rigidly still as statues, their faces tucked away from both us and the man driving them, rocking only involuntarily with the slight rocking of the vehicle. 

My hands, always quick to concede anger, are clenched now.  I see him nodding exagerratedly in our direction now, which is driving my father to learn even further out the window in an attempt to reach out and smack the other vehicle. 

The scenario is becoming clear now. He likely lives in the area, and he has called--sucessfully, judging from his satisfied threatning nods--for backup. 
 
 My father, having suddnely reoccupied his seat, instructs Amrit to fall back now. He then tells Amrit to tail him whereever he goes. 
 
 From the tone in which he says this, I sense that he has not giving up, and his set on consumating anger. At the same time I am taken slightly aback by his sudden change in demeanour. He seems quiet yet relaxed, disinterested yet not undetermined. 
 
 I throw some words at him, just as a feeler to figure out what kind of state he is in. I try humour, try to paint the situation as not a big deal, adressing it as a thing of the past. 
 
 I cap off my attempt by asking how far we are from home now. He isn't really paying attention. 
 
 He puts a reassuring hand on my back. I want to believe in the gentility of the gesture, but instead I search for anger lurking in the silence. He playfully slaps my back a couple of times before speaking.
 
  
 *Koi Gal Ni, Putt. Darn di lod nahi*.
 
 ( Don't worry, *putt*. No need to be afraid.) 
 
It is that one word. *Putt*. I know too well how variable the meaning of endearing words coming out of my father's mouth can be, in different contexts. It feels strangely out of context now, and I try to find in my memory something similiar in my memory . I am still trying to parase his words, trying to decide how to feel about them, as he leans past me into the front of the car. 

His hand reaches for the armrest between Tejji and Amrit.  I had not noticed it before, but that middle compartment is odd. It seems larger than it should be. 
 
He starts peeling it open, slowly, the way he peels back decorative layers from sacred texts. 

My head turns away before whatever rests in that dark cavity is revealed to me.

I do not want to see it. I do not want to know.

 I know though, I am only prolonging confirmation the way one under blankets prolongues exposing the body to the unanticipated cold in the room. 
 
My head falls back, I let it, let it bounce off the headrest a couple of times. 

My hands rise up seemingly of their own accord to touch my forehead, as if unsure of where else to rest. 

This too is familiar. This sense of being in a place which I can never be prepared for. All I can do it let things play out, and that is crediting myself too much, for things happen regardless of whether I let them or not. 
 
For a moment, for one still moment inside that vehicle driving casually into certain violence, perhaps only as a last ditch desperate effort to escape a sense of disconcertment, I wonder:  am I dreaming and about to wake up, or am I really experiencing this scenario? 

Just breathe.
