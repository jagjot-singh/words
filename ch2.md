## Jonny

I met Jonny a few a days after coming to Canada.

His family lived on the same street as my Aunt, a dozen houses east.

We became friends right away, and over the next few weeks, became good friends.

That first summer, before school started, we spent nearly every day together. I would wake up before him, go over to his house, where his parents would be at work, and Jonny and his brother Gary, would still be sleeping.

The two brothers stayed up late playing video games and wathing television, a luxury which was strictly rationed in my Aunt's house. So usually being more refreshed, I'd wake Jonny up, he'd make some chai, and we'd consider our options for the day.

Initially, a lot of our activites involved biking. We loved our BMX bikes, and often pushed our limits until one of us was hurt, or very close to.

Other times we felt a bit mischevious, and would steal some golf clubs--me from my uncle, he from his brother's set--and go the the school park spanning across our homes.

There, a cranky old caretaker with a big old German Shepard, would come out to yell at and pursure us as soon he noticed golf balls being hit towards his a small caretaking house on the far side of the park. We would bring a bucked of golf balls that Jonny always seemed to refill, and didn't mind losing them, as we often did.

We also did constructive things, like repair our own bikes and those of family and friends. Jonny's mechanical and engineering aptitude was immediately apparent to me, and I was continually struck by his ability to not only diagnose and correct mechanical issues, but tinker with and create things at will. Sharing this interest but havinig nowhere near his skill, it was tremendously educational for me to watch how he did things, trying to see things the way he saw them.

I quickly learned Jonny was not considered academicaly gifted by any means, and this largely had to do with his poor reading skills, which had to do with his lack of practice in reading and writing, which had to do with his own lack of interest in the matter and his parent's continual absence from the home allowing him to onyl do things that he liked. I only began piecing this together once school began, and though we were the same age and went to the same school, Jonny was a year behind. I realized that the confidence with which he took apart and put bicycles together, played video games, did not extend to the domain of words, letters, and characters in books or screens.

That enviroment was a safe haven for me, coming from a home where the rules weren't always clear or explicit, but conformity to the rules was the unwavering expectation. Anything but was out of the ordinary, heresy.

So that was home provided some of my first good impressions of the country, and in some ways was more of a home than my Aunt's. Not only did it and the resitdents have a freedom which reminded me of my parent's house and Punjab in general, but it also had the same ability to expose me to new interesting things and experiences. I learned what beer tasted like, and wondered why any sane person would put their palette through such a horrific experience. We experimented with fireworks and explosives which were plentyful as Jonny's older brother--who was in his twenties--bootlegged them across the states, and enlisted our help in slling them around Halloween time.
One day I went over to discover that Jonny had dragged home the frame of a golf-cart, which we had discovered the previous day, abandoned in a ditch we crossed on the way home from school.
