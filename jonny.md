## Houses and homes

I met J a few a days after coming to Canada, an event merely exciting then, and one that I'm increasingly grateful for with the passing of years.

His family lived in the same west-coast Canadian suburb, on the same side of the same street as my new guardian family. About a dozen houses east. A hundred steps or so. I could run there in under a minute probably.

J's house looked like most houses on the street, like most of the houses in the country, I'd later realize. Two-storied, rectangular, sandwiched by symmetrical back and front yards. The yards used exclusively to supply the nation-wide not-for-profit industry of home-grown grass. The grass is ritually harvested, packaged, and then offered to slow grazing herds of green trucks. With amazement I watched the professional feeders, clinging expertly onto their rumbling truck with a single wiry arm, their other hand tossing grass packages into it's gaping mechanical jaw, cerimoniously.


On my way to becoming Canadian, perhaps the first mantra I subconsciously consumed was: *The spare land surrounding a house shall grow grass*. Even house-owners who couldn't or wouldn't partake in the harvest, would actually pay others( even children!) to harvest it on their behalf, and even lend them the tools to do so.

My new Canadian house though, was a member of a visibile minority among Canadian houses. It grew hard edgy rocks in the front, and rocks and a couple of trees in the backyard. Making occasional offerrings, small bundles of weeds and dirt sometimes, and rarely a few branches and twigs, my new housed did not attract very many trucks with the scent of freshly cut grass on those days the rest of the houses street were saturated with it. 

I'd soon pick up on other, subtler differences between my house and J's. If 'home' can be agreed upon as a subjective feeling a person may or may not experience towards a given house, then the distance between our houses was really continents apart. His house feeling like a home I had left behind; my house, only a house.

Besides J, his family consisted of two older brothers, and two parents. His mother worked two jobs, I would hear her telling J routinely. She sometimes came home early enough to cook dinner, most nights just in time for sleep though. She left in the morning before anyone else woke up. 

Sometimes when she came home early, and caught J and I playing video games, she woud make me pause and play a game with her me that made J roll his eyes and say 'mom' really slowly. She would ask me to pick numbers for what I would only later learn was called the Lotto 6/49. 

I alway tried hard, closing my eyes, I took my time, slowly stating what felt to be the best numbers on that day. She would fill in the numbers as they came out of my mouth. I didn't dare tell her the truth: that I didn't actually know how to play. Her eyes were too wide and too kind. And if I asked J for help he ignored me, sometimes telling me to ignore her, which she would ignore, her eyes staying focused on me.  Eyes too kind to ignore. I played that game about once a week with her, my own dishonest eyes always closed, hoping that the next time would be the time she would win, more ready each time for her to confront me about pretending to know what I was doing. 

J's father rarely spoke to J, never to me, and could occasinally be seen in the evenings. Those evenings came at the end of the days he had finished work early at their farm on the outskirts of the city. On those days J would become suddenly reserved and quiet, out of some mixture of fear and respect that I supposed was expected of him. 

J's eldest brother well into his twenties, and was away for days, weeks at a time. When he was home we would carefully watch his every action, every movement, until he got visibily annoyed and told us to go play outside, or disappeared himself. I never asked where, and J never explained.

The middle brother was decidedly quiet and introverted, with sporadic bursts of mania here and there. Two years older than J and I, both ten, he was not particularily confident nor bright, and thus naturally became subject to our influence and even our approval. To his credit, he often surpassed our expectations in the challenges we playfully set for him. To our delight, our pestering demands of him to prove his worth through ridiculous feats, such as tasting beer from a can we had stolen from the eldest brother's room, were inexplicably important to him; he really tried, and drank that beer until he gagged.  And to our credit perhaps, there were also times when he simply had had enough of us, and would lose his temper. It was after such occasions that, during J and I's combined effort at actue generousity, to get back on his good side, their house felt the most like home.

My own brother now seemingly worlds and planets away, though terrestrial land and water seperated us, was a very emotionally volatile creature. Being around J and his brother I would periodically have the familiar fearful feeling of having unintentionally pushed someone to their emotional limits. Such incidents would naturally be followed by an also familiar, guilt-driven consolation on my part, only now I wasn't alone in this experience. J was in the same boat, and he even bore the brunt of the most extreme outbursts from his brother, who felt close enough to me to let me see unfiltered rage, but thankfully not close enough to direct it exclusively at me. And just like my brother, J's brother gained bursts of superhuman strength and feline unpredictability during fits of rage. 

Unlike my scrawny and wiry brother though, whose clinging attacks tended to be capped off by teeth and nails puncturing my skin, J's much bigger and much rounder brother simply wished to club us to death. During such outbursts J and I would have no choice but to grapple his flailing limbs to the point of a collective exhuastion which preceeded negotations, negotiations that often concluded in him being allowed a ride on J's blue BMX, or my eventual yellow one, sometimes even both! Both bikes, like anything he saw as mine or J's, were shamelessly coveted by him.

We developed comradarie right away, and in a few weeks, became inseperably good friends.

So that first Canadian summer, before beginning fifth grade, my daily routine started with waking up, and as soon as I was not being accounted for, running home to J's house, where his parents would be at work, where I had a familiar freedom, and where J would still be sleeping.

J invariably stayed up late playing video games and watching television, activities which were strictly rationed luxuries in my new house. Usually being more refreshed, I became his wake up call, prompting him to make chai. Then we would scheme about the day whislt drinking chai, me being secretly jealous that I couldn't make chai that tasted good. Thus the days began, and effectively ended at curfew, which I pushed as far as I could, but quickly learned to be unnegotiable.

Post-curfew, if lucky, I'd get to watch television or play video games. If unlucky I'd be assigned chores, or made to study material which failed to capture my attention. If very unlucky, I would be studying my feet while being scolded for something I'd have to pretend to understand to make the scolding stop. When in a limbo state somewhere between lucky and unlucky, I began escaping into reading and drawing. Time outside the house, something which I had taken for granted up until then, suddenly became very precious.

Initially, J and I's activites were limited to biking and exploring. I had a to lot to learn, he had a lot to show me. I naturally fell in love with BMX bikes, and after a few months of pleading my case, was able to acquire my own. My bicycle in Punjab had been an adult's road bike, functional, designed purely for commutte. A BMX entices the rider to play, and with J bringing me up to speed on play-riding, I was soon jumping over things, skidding, sliding, both of us continually trying to one-up the other, until one of us got hurt or "shook".

"Yo you shook?"

"No I ain't shook"

Always meant someone was, either the person asking or answering.

The more we explored, the more confident and daring we became. Perhaps the first game we created out of what can only honestly be described as sheer mischief, was the game of *borrowing* golf clubs, me from my guardian uncle; he from his absent eldest brother's unused set. Then we would walk over to the high school field tucked behind the church and parking lot, spanning nearly the length of our street, on the opposite side of our houses.

The duration of the game was often decided by the cranky caretaker who lived  in a tiny house on the far side of the fields. When he was around, he never missed the opportunity to come out yelling and pursuing us before casually collecting the golf balls that we'd sent flying and bouncing in his general direction. We rarely managed to land one within ten meters of his house. It was a something of a dream of ours, something we fancied ourselves to be progressing towards, to send one flying in through one of his windows. The game went on like this that summer. We showed up swinging, he came out cursing, and we took off taunting. Sometimes we would be back the very next day, with a heaping bucket of balls that J always managed to top up somehow.

There was also mcuh time spent by us developing constructive skills, like performing unnecessary repairs on ours bikes, sometimes even to those of family and friends. Jonny's mechanical aptitude was immediately apparent to me, and I was continually struck by his ability to not only diagnose mechanincal problems, but also to tinker with and seemingly create things at will. Sharing this interest but having nowhere near his skill, it was educational for me to just watch how he did things, learning to see things the way he saw them.

There had been signs throughout the summer, but it wasn't until aferwards when school officialy started that I realized J had severe difficulty in both reading and writing. From so much time spent around him, it was intuitively apparent to me that his difficulty largely had to do with a lack of practice in reading and writing, which resulted from his own lack of interest in the matter, and also his parent's inablity to prevent him from only doing things that he found enjoyable. 

So it was that when school began, despite being the same age in the same small elementary school, J was a year behind, and we were in different classrooms. 

I felt confused and pained by an injustice to which I felt like the only witness. I began developing anger towards J, seeing that the wise-cracking confidence with which he took apart and put machines together, beat high-scores in video games, made chai every morning, was entirely absent from the domain of words and letters. 

The same boy whom I had helped to pull out an abandoned, mutilated golf cart out from a ditch, dragged it home with him, watched mesmerized, as he turned it into a running go-kart in two weeks, using lawnmower and bicycle parts, that same boy was not seen fit to sit in a fifth grade classroom with me.
