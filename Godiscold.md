I write in the closing months of twenty sixteen. 

In such a comically-morib   --or morbidly-comic, depending on one's tastes--  state of affairs is our world is that a remarkable thing has been long enough, has affected enough minds of enough range of ages that I feel just in invoking past tense and saying that the thing has happened, actually, and it's going to keep on happening fron here on forth; it's a given thing now.

The thing isn't a simple idea. I know no dozen words which immediatedly paint a meaningful portrait of the thing, but perhaps what the thing is, is that it's some unprecedented level of resonance and ampfliction of some thing that already was so of course, we say that it is. 
That resonance being the resonating of an axiom in our minds, the axiom that: the state of affairs of the world is in is decidedly bad. 

Of course people have felt this, and felt that it was common knowledge, long before we felt and knew it. 

But the thing is, now for the very first time ever, seemingly ireversible, and seemingly independant of any other  knowledge to be had in the world. 

Technology, Websites, Chat Applications, Forums, Instagram are among the few contributors to the seeming irreversibility of the thing. What we see resonates in these things, and anyone looking carefully, honestly at them, can pin an underlying attitude betraying adherence to the above axiom.

That's just the thing. I find it very interesting, but not nearly strange as this phenomenon which, while I know not how it preciesly relates to the thing, I can't help but feel it must, because the thing is the only thing diferrent in this last century. 

Perhaps it is new and different on a much longer timescale, I cannot confidently say beyond the century, whcih is as far as I wish to look before turning away.

God is cold. 

He is not only cold, but cold is He.
