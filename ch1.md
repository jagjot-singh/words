## Ottawa


######February in Ontario, Canada.

The sun set a couple hours ago. Our unnecessarily large and comfortable Chevy SUV, which all but takes the joy out of driving fast, is cruising down the off-ramp. We're pulling into Ottawa. Capital of Canada, where the Presidents live and senators play.  My partener--I will refer to him simply as B--and I have driven five hours from Toronto to Ottawa, to work here for one week. We are in the St laurent area, checking into an unimpressive four-star hotel. It's my first time to the city, and knowing that it will soon fade, I still feel the mild excitement of checking into a hotel in a new city. The hotel is in an industrial area, not a beautiful place, but not ugly either. Just very plain and Canadian. Box-buildings which with relative ease could be converted into airplane hangars, and well paved double-laned roads. Organized, functional, stamped perhaps just a bit too firmly onto the landscape. We've been to worse areas and stayed in motels for this job so in truth, we're in no position to complain. But on a couple rare occasians, when management couldn't find anything cheapers, we'd ended up in luxury hotels. That was enough us have hope each time.


B and I both have love-hate relationship with this job. We hate the the actual work. Our manager war fired a couple months ago. So we're technically unmanaged, and have such sparse communication with the comapny that it usually just entails the place we're going, and usually we got this information the night before. So we're also not fond of anyone in the company. We're part of a sales campaign that's been ongoing for nearly the decade. As the guys in the field, we know the end is in sight. The market has become impressively saturated. And this is commission based job, so we're also startiing to hate the pay.

What we both love is the travel, and Cannabis.

And on this night, as we claim our beds and sides of the room, we realize we have only a couple grams of weed between us. B has a friend in Monteal, which is three hours away. So while we spice that night--spice is our code word for smoking marijuana--we decide that if it really came down to it, we'd go to Montreal. We were already plannig on catching a concert there at the end of the week, we don't complicate things by acknowledging the fact that we'd run out in at most a couple of days.


I'm lying in bed Just one week, I can put my head down and do this. Exhausted, I fall asleep
I got to know a few of the other guests staying there throughout the week.

My car was usually parked by Wayne’s room. He was living at this hotel indefinitely,
 until the city found adequate housing for him and his service dog, coco.
 I initially made friends with coco, who would later introduce me to Wayne. Coco sat on a cushion outside Wayne’s door. Considering the temperatures were around negative 10 I instantly felt concern for him. I soon realized though that he was perfectly content there, and would rap on the door if needed to go in to drink water, which would of course, have frozen outside.

My interaction with coco was reduced to a greeting in the morning before work, and playing with him for a few minutes after dinner.

On my second last night there, I happened to be sitting in the car outside Wayne’s door when he came up and knocked on the window. I rolled it down and he asked if I was leaving.

In truth, I had intended on just sitting there and listening to music for a bit. I had some cannabis—an indica strain that would ease me into sleep—and I was toying with the idea of smoking it as well. I told him I was not planning on going anywhere, and asked if he needed something. He was hoping I could get cigarettes for him.

I ended up driving to a nearby gas station where he bought cigarettes. He was very thankful and on the way back described a documentary he had been watching before we left. I was impressed by how passionate he seemed about the subject and people in the documentary. I was paying more attention to him than what he was actually saying so I remember little about the film itself. Terrorists, some woman from Vancouver. She may have been killed but he hadn’t yet got to the part where that was revealed.

After I drove back and he left, I sat there for a few minutes, in the darkness of the car. It was pretty late now, and it had been a long and tiring day at work. I would be restless just going to sleep then. I decided to smoke a bowl and listen to some jazz, letting my thoughts run where they please.

I was in a very pleasant mood when a pick up truck that I had seen a couple of times before parked next to me. It’s driver got out and knocked on my window. I was a bit surprised, and knew the car smelled strongly of marijuana, but I was in a pleasant mood, and didn’t worry as I opened the door.

Hello brother, how are you?

The man who looked back at me seemed of Arabic descent, perhaps Turkish. With a bit of an accent hr warmly answers me. Good good bro,! How are you? Listen bro, I was hoping you have some for me.

He pinches his thumb and forefinger together to his mouth and takes an exaggerated satisfying inhale. I nodded and said yes I could help him out. He thanked me a dozen times before I could go back into the hotel to fetch it for him.

When I came back, he was in his truck. He shook my hand warmly as I handed him a couple of buds, and looked teary eyed. He said he worked 11 hour days doing construction labour, and this was something be needed badly as he had run out a couple days ago. His friend was bringing him has but wouldn’t get there for a few days. The way he opened the bad and inhaled the smell with relief made me feel sad for him.

I knew the toll my 8 hour work days took on me, and that was without any labour. I was happy to have helped him. He tried to pay me with a fifty dollar bill. I politely declined, only to be offered a 20 dollar bill. At ten dollars I caved in, as I felt it was important to him to give back to me.

After a dozen more thank yous I wished him good night. I went to bed feeling a bit surreal, and closed my eyes.
