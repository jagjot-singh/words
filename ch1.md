## Ottawa

Winter, February 2016. It's dark as I pull off the highway and into the city of Ottawa. My partener, B and I have driven five hours from Toronto to Ottawa, and will be working here for a week. It's my first time to the city, and I feel the mild excitement I usually feel checking into a hotel in a city I have never been to. They've put us up in a four-star hotel in the St laurent area. It's an industrial area, not a beautiful place, but not ugly either. We've been to worse areas and stayed in some shady motels for this job, so we're in no position to complain. But occasian we've ended up in luxury hotels.

Lying in bed Just one week, I can put my head down and do this. Exhausted, I fall asleep
I got to know a few of the other guests staying there throughout the week.

My car was usually parked by Wayne’s room. He was living at this hotel indefinitely,
 until the city found adequate housing for him and his service dog, coco.
 I initially made friends with coco, who would later introduce me to Wayne. Coco sat on a cushion outside Wayne’s door. Considering the temperatures were around negative 10 I instantly felt concern for him. I soon realized though that he was perfectly content there, and would rap on the door if needed to go in to drink water, which would of course, have frozen outside.

My interaction with coco was reduced to a greeting in the morning before work, and playing with him for a few minutes after dinner.

On my second last night there, I happened to be sitting in the car outside Wayne’s door when he came up and knocked on the window. I rolled it down and he asked if I was leaving.

In truth, I had intended on just sitting there and listening to music for a bit. I had some cannabis—an indica strain that would ease me into sleep—and I was toying with the idea of smoking it as well. I told him I was not planning on going anywhere, and asked if he needed something. He was hoping I could get cigarettes for him.

I ended up driving to a nearby gas station where he bought cigarettes. He was very thankful and on the way back described a documentary he had been watching before we left. I was impressed by how passionate he seemed about the subject and people in the documentary. I was paying more attention to him than what he was actually saying so I remember little about the film itself. Terrorists, some woman from Vancouver. She may have been killed but he hadn’t yet got to the part where that was revealed.

After I drove back and he left, I sat there for a few minutes, in the darkness of the car. It was pretty late now, and it had been a long and tiring day at work. I would be restless just going to sleep then. I decided to smoke a bowl and listen to some jazz, letting my thoughts run where they please.

I was in a very pleasant mood when a pick up truck that I had seen a couple of times before parked next to me. It’s driver got out and knocked on my window. I was a bit surprised, and knew the car smelled strongly of marijuana, but I was in a pleasant mood, and didn’t worry as I opened the door.

Hello brother, how are you?

The man who looked back at me seemed of Arabic descent, perhaps Turkish. With a bit of an accent hr warmly answers me. Good good bro,! How are you? Listen bro, I was hoping you have some for me.

He pinches his thumb and forefinger together to his mouth and takes an exaggerated satisfying inhale. I nodded and said yes I could help him out. He thanked me a dozen times before I could go back into the hotel to fetch it for him.

When I came back, he was in his truck. He shook my hand warmly as I handed him a couple of buds, and looked teary eyed. He said he worked 11 hour days doing construction labour, and this was something be needed badly as he had run out a couple days ago. His friend was bringing him has but wouldn’t get there for a few days. The way he opened the bad and inhaled the smell with relief made me feel sad for him.

I knew the toll my 8 hour work days took on me, and that was without any labour. I was happy to have helped him. He tried to pay me with a fifty dollar bill. I politely declined, only to be offered a 20 dollar bill. At ten dollars I caved in, as I felt it was important to him to give back to me.

After a dozen more thank yous I wished him good night. I went to bed feeling a bit surreal, and closed my eyes.
