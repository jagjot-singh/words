The warm smell of whisky fills my nostrils as I wonder whether the fumes are gently burning my nose and throat. I am sitting at a small table, across from my mother's uncle. He has just finished telling me about the time my mother my spent here while she studied at university, which at the time was about a two hour busride from here. This is knowledge I have already come by from my mother, but it is the first time that Mama Ji has ever spoken so frankly to me without being drunk to the point of incoherence, so I do not interrupt. Even so, my uncertainty with the situation must have shown, as after finishing his story, he looks at me and laughs. Putting down his empty glass on the table, he aligns it with the just above half-full bottle of Ballentines, and starts to pour me another glass of sweet lassi from the jug on my side of the table. As soon as the glass is full, he empties it back into the Jug, and then repeats. I watch in silence as his pours get longer each time. While doing this, he becomes serious again.

*When you drink nourishing things--like this lassi--this lassi becomes part of you. Drink liquor--it is a type of fire--and it takes a part of you.*

He sets down a full glass of lassi in front of me now, and refills his own. Raising the short wide glass to the light, he slowly begins to rotates it. Light begins dancing on through the liquid and single piece of ice floating in it. It has a spectacular glow which proves to me that there is indeed fire there.

*It always takes, and given enough time, you have to pass through liquor's gate just to visit yourself.*

*Did your mother ever tell you I was amritdhari?*

She had not. I slowly shake my head.

His eyes now have in them a sheen which I've only seen before when he is both very drunk emotional, but I know that he is not yet drunk by his standards. My head is filling with questions I dare not ask. I try to look for answers in his eyes. I have become accustomed to a familiar pattern during the visits to this house, the same stories, the same food, the same activities happening throughout the house orchestrated by the same people.

And now at the sudden breaking of this pattern by having been asked to sit with Mammah Ji alone, I am nervous and excited. I have only seen him drinking in the company of other adults, and am quite unsure about how to conduct myself and rather than chugging the sweet lassi as was my norm, I find myself drinking slowly, in small gulps swallowed slowly to keep the taste in my mouth as long as possible.

Mammah Ji pours himself another dose of whisky. My eyes are focused on the glass full of liquid fire with his hands wrapped around it as he leans slighlty forward towards me. As each word enters my ears, my nose is hit by a wave of sweet warmth.

*You know, Sikhi has never been properly damaged by anyone outside force. There have been plenty such efforts, but always they've actually made it stronger. Always there have been too many Sikhs willing to become Shaheeds.*

He pauses and looks at me as if guaging these effect of his words on me. He holds his gaze for what becomes an uncomfortably long period time, but intuitively sensing it inappropirate to look away, I match it and turn the urge to look away into a slow nod.

That seems to satisfy him. His expression briefly turns into a smile, and then tenses again as his words become a whisper.

*But you know, never in five hundred years has Sikhi's memory died as much as it has in my lifetime.*

I am suddenly stunned by the realization that though he may not be drunk as I know him to be, he is more emotional than I have ever seen him. Seeing a single tear fall from one eye, I look away, deciding to focus only on the voice.

*I get ashamed thinking of shaheeds who even looking into the darkness of rile-barrells, shouted Jakaras. For every one of them, there are hundreds like me, our Sikhi killed by just ink and paper. A lot of us died in 84 too, just quietly. This here, this was my witness.*

He gently rests a palm on the cap of the Ballentine's. Before I can put one together, he asks me a question.

*Do you remember your Bai?*

Meaning my great grandfather, whom I want to say that I do have memory of, but am now too absorbed in his strange but interesting stream of thought. Being self conscious of my position at this table, but determined to prove I belong there, I take the cautious route and remain silent. Mama Ji is looking off to the side and up, his head tilting to the side while his left hand rhythmically strokes his beard. I know this look well enough to know that he is in the middle of recalling something from the past. Sensing that I am about to hear a story I wait in anticipation.

*No no of course, you couldn't. You were still a baby when he passed.*

He suddenly perks up, eyes widening as his awareness snaps into the present from wherever it had just been. A breeze enters the room through an open window to my right, and I note with a bit of surorise that had it not been for my acute attentiveness to his words, the dancing curtains definetly would have gotten my attention.

*See now, he would know what I'm trying to say. He saw the british kill Sikhs with uniforms and money.
You probably don't even know, but he had a brother. A Gursikh, shaheed during the independance movement.*

There is no shame now in his moist eyes as they stare me unblinkingly. I sense that they are trying to tell me something not communicable by the words of the man across from me, and I wonder at what it is.

*You probably like me because of all I've done for your mother. You know, I would do the same for you too if you were going to study here... But why would you want to come back here once you've left...*

He sees that this digression hinting at my departure from India in two months, an event I do my best not to think about, has made me uncomfortable. Even as he quickly changes the topic and his tone softens, the mysterious wave of emotion attempts to expand in my chest as I fight it.

*Listen son, listen to this one thing. I know you will go on to learn a lot in school. Some things you cannot learn there though. Remeber this: you are born in a state of failed independance. The British held the key to free us, and they gifted that key to India, who gated and fenced Sikhi into as a small a space as they could. People like me and your grandfather, go ahead tell him I said this -- I won't truth that shames me -- people like me and him, we should have been breaking the gates down, but we didn't. You know what we did. We helped India to fence us in.

He is shaking his head with visible disgust. My grandfather had plenty of entertaining stories from his time served in the Indian military. My brother and I would pester him to retell our favorites, the details of which has started becoming increasingly blurry as his opium usage became more prominent. But unlike Mammah Ji I had never heard him speak of his time negative light. Like most of my knowledge about Mama Ji, I knew from my mother that he had served in the military but for a much shorter duraton than my grandfater. That he had returned unexpectadly one day, and had begun spending time alone in his room, where he could be heard praying in the mornings, where alcohol could be smelled by the evenings. And in those evenings he would become social, and began having guests over for animated discussions. Mother speculated that as a result of those meetings he started selling and buying land. An interest which proved not only profitable, but according to my mother, became the only thing that brought him out of the gloom he had come back with.

I am sitting with him in that same room now, where he had been sitting for so many years praying, talking, drinking, gaining wealth. The accumulation of the very same wealth which had funded my mother through university, making her the first woman in both sides of the family to obtain university education.


*It was a confusing time to be a Sikh. Many of those previously willing to give their lives for Sikhi weren't so sure anymore. The british were a new kind of people. They left but much of their system was kept. It survives because it works too well at disgusing opression as something necessary. They knew how to dazzle us with their academia and technology. I remember seeing some officer demonstrate a machine gun once when I was teenager. He was firing at corn then, but it was the same gun they later used mow down thousands like corn Jallian Wala Bagh, but you know about that. Anyways, they convinced us that our swords and rifles could be traded for pen and paper without losing our identity. Many horrible things they were but they were undeniably smart the goras. They knew maybe even better than us that swords are what bring us closer to Gurbani, that pens and papers would divide us. And look at us today...just look at what we must go through to be armed. Joining the Indian army is the common way, the easiest way, we've even become proud of it.*


*Paperwork ... writing ... English words... that's just it. Don't you ever think that death is not connected to the dance of pen on paper, it starts right there and then. You have an Indian passport now don't you? You can die anywhere in the world... anywhere doing anything... but to the world you will die an Indian. Eighty-four onwards, Indias army has been killing us. Why use anything else when they can do it with words on paper? So much text for us to look at now, so many details...everything beckoning our attention away from the words in Gurbani. Sikhs dieing without knowing that they are...that is the real power of India.*

*Indira Gandhi knew that as well as--*

At that instant, Mammi Ji's head pokes through the doorway and announce that dinner is ready. With no regard to our conversation, she calls me to come with her, and I look at Mama Ji hoping for him to override her request so our dialogue may continue. He looks defeated though, and motions for me to go with her.

I didn't get a chance to ask him anything later that night, nor ever again. Many years later I would see him, but he never opened up like that again.
