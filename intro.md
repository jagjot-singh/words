Forgive me Lord, 
For I have lived in places I should never have gone

Take my heart O' Lord,
For it cannot stop seeing things I never saw

Lift me up O' Lord,
For each morning I rise to prayer and yet I fall

Lend me Grace O' Father,
For my feet feel heavy and my hands hope for a wall

Hear my cries O' Creator
For the tears I cannot shed, I put into art
