#That's Us

I am at this cafe I sometimes eat at. Same dish every time I come. Steamed eggplant on white rice, it's delicious the way the make it.

Aappearence-wise I am slightly conscious of being an absoulte mess today. It is too cold for me to care. I've been rushing the entire day, trying to limit my time outdoors as I half walk and half run to and from places, running errands. My Dastaar fails to cover many protruding hairs, but all is fair in the midst of a Toronto winter, I keep telling myself. 

I watch that winter inflict it's glory now from the warmth and safety of the centrally heated building, through a large street-facing (Spadina Avenue in Chinatown) window which I always sit facing. Soft soft snow coming down so so hard at such strange angles. I can't see the opposite side of the street, obscured by whiteness. Occasionally someone passes, sheilding their faces from some combination of wind and snow.


After inhaling the amazing eggplant dish, which truly amazes me everytime at how well-prepared it is-- the salty peanut-sauce drizzled generously on top, which soaks slightly into the thin eggplant slices, and bit more decidedly into the perfectly cooked white rice below. And then everything mixes with the sour flavour of the eggplant in one's mouth, a wonderous explosion of texture and flavor--after all of this, I craved something sweet. So I decided to order a smoothie, something I'm not done here, and maybe that is why I'm having trouble explaining it to the server.

She could be Thai, perhaps Japanese, maybe even Korean ... I cannot tell.

Having seen her here a few times before, I get the feeling that she is still fairly new to speaking English, to the country perhaps. I've caught her off guard now, she just happened to be passing by, without a menu she always carried when taking orders. Slightly bewildered at my sudden utterance of "something something ...smoothie", she regains her composure, smiles politely, and asks me

"You wanna see menu?"

I nod, and she leaves to get a menu.

She places the menu in front of me, I trace my finger to the smoothie section, circling and hovering it as I scan for something sweet but not too sweet, and finally land it on top of avocado-peach.
 
As soon as my finger touches down, I am caught off-guard. Her voice, suddenly having taken a strange tone I would not expect in such a context between two relative strangers, and also in a mysteriously Canadian-English accent far better than anything I expected of her, now says
 
 "Thats us ... Thats cold." 

Dumbfounded, I turn my head towards her, hoping for some clue, any clue, as to what her words might mean.

She's leaning slightly onto the table, over my left shoulder, (a bit too close? I wonder), with her head angled down towards the menu. In addition to being confused by her words, I am now also mesmarized by the look of on her face, a face that I now find myself noticing is quite pretty, a pretty face which now has on it a look that is somewhere between concern and amazement.

"You sure?"

She asks, in a slightly more inquisitive and less amazed tone.

And it clicks. Those two words snap me out of it.

 Ice... She said that's ice. The smoothie, made with ice.
 
 That's ice. That's cold...

A strange relief comes over me as I chuckle and tell her yes, that's fine.
