#That's Us

I am at this cafe I sometimes eat at. Same dish every time. Eggplant on white rice, it's delicious the way the make it.

Appearence-wise I am an absoulte mess today. It is too cold for me to care. My hat barely covers protruding hair, but all is fair in the midst of a Toronto winter.

I watch that winter inflict it's glory now from the warmth and safety of a centrally heated building, through a large street-facing (Spadina Avenue in Chinatown) window I always sit facing. Soft soft snow coming down so hard at an angle. I can't even see the opposite end of the street. Occasionally someone passes, often sheilding their faces from some combination of wind and snow.


After the amazing eggplant dish, which amazes me everytime at how well-prepared it is-- the salty peanut sauce drizzled on top, which although soaks the thin eggplant slices, only mixes slightly into the perfectly cooked white rice below. And then everything mixes with the sour flavour of the eggplant in one's mouth, a wonderous explosion of texture and flavor--after all of this, I craved something sweet. So I decided to order a smoothie, something I'm now having trouble explaining to the server.

She could be Thai, perhaps Japanese, maybe even Korean ... I cannot tell.

Having seen her here a few times before, I get the feeling that she is farily new to speaking English. I've caught her off guard now, she just happened to be passing by, without a menu she always carried when taking orders. Having initillay seemed slightly bewildered at my sudden utterance of something something smoothie, she regains her composure as she smiles politely, and asks me

You wanna see the menu?

I nod, and she leaves to get a menu.

She places the menu in front of me, I trace my finger to the smoothie section, circle my hovering finger for a second as I scan for something sweet but not too sweet, and land it on top of avocado-peach.
 
As my finger lands, I am surprised. Her voice suddenly having taken a strange tone, in a Canadian English accent that was far better than I had come to expect of her, she says  Thats us ... Thats cold. 

I turn my head towards her, hoping for some clue as to what those words might mean.

She's leaning slightly onto the table, her head angled over my shoulder, down towards the menu. I am both confused by her words, and mesmarized by the look of on her face, which is one of both concern and also confusion.

You sure?

Those words snap me out of it. Suddenly it clicks. Ice. She said that's ice. The smoothie, made with ice.

A strange relief comes over me as I chuckle and tell her yes, that's fine.
