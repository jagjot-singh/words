## Kyokushin

My body is shifting, expanding, and constricting in strange and curious ways. I am continually reminded by teachers at school that this is simply a process known as 'puberty'.  Some of the teachers seem amused by our ongoing morphosis while others seem curiously compassionate. Some of them repeatedly mention that it is a totally normal and regular part of 'growing up', while the language of others colors it as an uncomfortable and even inconvenient experience that we must suffer through, much the same as getting sick.


The teachers are always giving us examples of puberty, perhaps to put us at ease, perhaps to become more relatable, but I am continually disappointed as they always mention body-hair, voice-cracking, skin blemishes, etc., but none mention anything about hand-clenching. I have seen no noticeable change in body-hair, and  while my voice has become noticeably deeper, my skin actually appears smoother and shinier. The most alarming change I am experiencing is the odd sensation of being surpised to find that my hands, which are starting to look much too large for my thin wrists, have suddenly and inexplicably clenched themselves into tight fists. One day when I notice a classmates hands also seem unproportiantely large for his wrists, I start watching his hands to see if I can catch them clench without his will. I lose interest after he repeatedly and unsuccesffuly picks at a scab on his ankle using a ruler, which makes me feel disgusted because it would have taken me a second to pick it off cleanly. I resign my hand-clenching to be a necessary part of puberty.

I have now started the sixth grade, and have not seen my father, mother, or brother for nearly two years. Books, biking, and video games are my escapes from an increasingly strange world, each activity exhausting and energizing in it's own way, and each comforting and familiar in it's own way. It feels good to ride my bike to the public library, where I can browse and read books without time restraints. I take out books that interest me, and bring them to school, reading them any chance I get. My teachers have expressed to my guardians their concerns about my becoming withdrawn from their classes.

During parent-teacher meetings where time is slowed down to a frighteningly slow pace, I listen to them explain as a doctor describing a diagnosis that besides physical education--which I see as liberation from class, rather than class itself--I am becoming less engaged in class, and some of them add with emphasis that I am even *disruptive in thier class*. I impatiently endure the various examinations and discussions on what should be done about me, and with a practiced indifference shrug off the occasional question, masking the discomfort and anxiety brought on by being adressed in this context. I have no interest in nor any way of explaining to them the surges of desire I am experiencing sitting there rigidly, day in and day out. Desires that despite being new and surprising to me, are so deeply rooted in my psyche that I intuitively feel the need to respect and obey them. I constantly feel the need to explore my own movement, it's new developments, it's new boundaries. I feel I should not have to explain this to anyone, as it should be clear by now that for whatever reason, I can not or will not sit still for the prolongued periods of class time.

Thus in a solution concieved with the percieved best interests of all parties involved, at age tweleve I am attending my first ever karate class.

Off to one side of the dojo--a gymnasium which serves as a pre-school during the day--I am with a few other new students. Out of this group, there is just one other kid, Daniel, also here for his first day, and we are the only two yet without *gi's*(uniforms). We are virtually the same height, same build, and have a lot of energy. Over the next few classes, we are to be paired up as sparring partners, and over the next few years, we would become good friends.

Coming into that first class, I had been extremely nervous. I had been looking forward to this the whole week, and wanted to prove to myself that I belonged here. After being given some basic intruction and left to the side with the other newcomers while the rest of the class went through what I assumed to be regular training, my nervousness started dissipating.

We had been given a quick demonstation of a proper straight punch, and are quietly throwing punches into the air, in our little corner of the dojo, against no one. Slowly but surely, my anger is arising with each punch, and I'm gaining focus with each punch.

*Now here is a guy that wants to fight!*

Those are his first ever words to me, as I'm startled by a strong pat on the back from *Shihan*, who is grinning ear to ear. There is evident strength and control in that slap as it racks my bony back. It has a firmness that is nor harsh nor gentle, but *just*. Unsure whether to feel encouraged or embarassed by his comment, I am stuck somewhere in between the two. As he proceeds to make improvements to my stance and technique while giving feedback, I begin seeing his gestures as fatherly, and feel myself becoming encouraged and easing into the whole experience.

*Shihan* is demonstrating perfect slow motion punches at an imaginary opponent in front of us. I am confounded by the combination of mechanical intricacy and dance-like fluidty apparent in his punches. If not betrayed by the shiny grey color of his hair and handlebar moustache, he would appear a much younger man. As he repeats the slow and exagerrated punches, I am focusing on and absorbing his every word and gesture.

*Only the first two knuckles ... the biggest ones ... should ever make contact.*

*Wrist straight!  Perfect line from shoulder to knuckle... Don't lean in and don't sit back ... *

*This hand punches, this hand pulls. *

*Power starts at the feet, comes up through the hips, and then moves to shoulders and arms.*

*Proper punches are thrown with the entire body, not parts of it.*

Slapping me on the back a second time, he moves on to improve someone else's punch. I repeat his words to myself silently as I think that here is a man I never want to disappoint.

Something about that open space filled with boys,girls,men and women all wearing the same bagy white attire, all repeating the same motions, all expending energy into the same movements, comforted me in a way I had never known. Here movement was not only encouraged, but it was expected and perfected. I knew then in that first class that this place, these people, these movements, and this energy would become part of me.

Hindsight is a remarkable gift, and a very underrated--and perhaps underused--aspect of human intelligence. Hindsight can not only apply creative and entertaining frames and context to the past, it can completley change our present attitudes. Sometimes in a single instant of realization, sometimes as suddenly and violently as an unexpected punch to the face. Positives can become negatives, and vice versa. Significance can be lost or gained. The power of hindsight can shuffle our lives, our enemies, and our friends, like a deck of cards.

And as it was around the time I began Karate, my perception of life and the futre was overwhelmingly negative. Acutely consicous of my own lonliness lacking trusted adult figures, I was seeking to hide myself inside myself. I trusted certain people in particular contexts, but could bring myself to trust no one enough to adress my inner volatility, where I was increasingly starting to feel like a helpless observer stuck in a combusting world where everything is destined to be fuel. Much of my my fuel then stemmed from the intuitive belief that I was stuck in an unjust life which I was not meant to be living, that if my parents were there with me, they would realize this and make necessary changes.

I did not even having an open channel of communication with my parents, our communication being influenced and rationed by my Aunt to an extent which they could not poosibly have realized. Thus, my hope for any outside help was fading.

And whatever hope conceded, anger claimed with a coldness which both terrified and excited me. Anger was the sympathizing personality that I didn't have. Anger was the strength to be uncompromising where I lacked the courage to put my foot down . With each compromise I experienced, a piece of me handed it's over loyalty to anger.

Much later in life, hindsight would frame this experience as a blessing in my life. Hindsight would do this by showing me that had I had a person in my life then whom I trusted and who sympathized with me, I would most likely have quit karate as soon as it became challenging.

And I would have missed out on the lessons which would shape me for life. I would have missed out on the intimiacy with suffering and anger provided in that controlled enviroment.




The very first time *Shihan* asked me to stay behind to train for tournament fighting, I had naivley assumed that I would be given some priveleged instructions and was excited at the prospect. He had been hinting since the first week that I would be trained to compete if I wished, and I had always expressed my wish to do so. So when that first bit training towards that goal was offered, I gladly agreed. I collapsed after about 40 minutes that first session. Walking home with my head down afterwards, as I willed my alien and rubbery legs to walk in the way I had taken for granted, the stream of cars driving by blended into a surreal symphony of beautiful sounds and vivid colors that would have been mesmirizng had I the energy to focus on them. As soon as I got home I collapsed into bed. When I woke up the next morning school I felt stangely at peace with the fact that I would be late for school. Despite having slept wearing my *gi*, I still found it difficult to think of the evening before as something other than a dream.

After the second such session, I was afraid of the training and began thinking of excuses to get out of it. When the time came of course I was always too embarassed and lacked the courage to express excuses to *Shihan*. By the third session I learned to only exert myself during the regualr class as much as I needed to, and started to bring polysporine and tape with me so I didn't have to expose my skinless knuckles to the cold or the roughness inisde my pockets during the walk home. I was promised the skin would eventaully grow back tougher.

By the sixth session I was impressed by the improvments, gaining confidence, and hungry for more. By then I had also started to see the pattern. *Shihan* pushed me and prodded me to the precise point where my personality ceased to exist, and the anger began. While his diverse arsenal of tactics ranged from sincere words to firm commands, from playful teasing to demeaning insults, from physical affection to physical assault, the end goal was always the same. Once I felt my limit had been reached, the anger boil over and flow outwards, and push the limits a little bit further with each explosion. While I learned to control the release and become comfortable in the ensuing state of fury, he learned to direct it.

The first time he ever broke me down was by simply making me do knuckle pushups to exhaustion. He is standing over me, yelling and insulting me for my inability to lift myself off the floor as I strain to use my unfamiliar unrespnsive arms. I strain and grunt with effort, but it is futile. Beyond pathetic uncontrollable trembling and shaking, I can produce no movement. I feel locked in my own body and defeated, unable to move my chest even a inch off the floor. My face is contorted in shame and I can feel sobs coming up into my chest. With this realization, a sudden panic and desperation come over me. I welcomed the desperation, as anything is better than crying here and now, and being exposed in this way. I explode into rage, scream and slam my knucles into the hardwood floor as hard as I can.

*Don't get mad at me, now. I'm not the bad guy here. Get mad at the bag!*

He is grinning ear to ear as he whispers this, while pulling me up. I am shaking and breathing heavily as he turns me towards the punching bag. He pats my back, and I enter a private world where only my anger and the bag exist. My fists feel just, I feel no pain, and the bag is every unjust thing in the world. I consider this experience as nothing short into a glimpse of the workings of God.

There is perhaps nothing so humbling and perspective-changing for a boy entering manhood to be pushed unbelievably far beyond his own percieved limits. To suddenly realize the physical strength which he has been admiring and respecting in others his whole life, can just be expressions of emotion. Nothing in life can be the same afterwards. It is an incredibly addicting thing to witness one's own limits and weaknesses as the precursors to previously uncharted strenghts, applying nothing but faith and persistence. It gave me a confidence I had not had before, not in myself, but in the world.


I'm at my first ever Karate tournament. I have never witnessed a tournament before, but after spending the last few months training specifically for it, here I am to compete in one.

I feel ready. I feel like I have been moulded into something that belongs here. I had been training hard for this. I am nervous, but thinking about training gives me confidence.

Now here I stand in this huge cavernous space filled with people who whom this was familiar to, and I find myself feeling self-consious of my status among them. The only person who knows the part of me which I know belongs here is *Shihan*, and as he is one of the judges, he is fully occupied with and involved in the preceedings.

I weigh in at just over 115 pounds,  and am placed in the 130 pounds and under, full contact category.

The tournament is in a big gymnasium at the British Columbia Institue of Technology. There are thousands of people of all shapes, sizes and colors. Hundreds of whom  can be identified as fighters, most of whom are older than and tower above me.

As I still have a couple of hours to kill until my first fight, I wander over to an adjacent gymnasium to stretch. Dan's mother has driven us down and he is somewhere in the stands with her and his brothers.

I find a mat and start doing splits. I feel a sense of relief in the fact that no one knows me here, and no one is here to watch me. I tell myself that if I do well here today, I would ask to call my father so I could tell him. In this way I manage to curb some of the pressure that has been building up inside me. Pressure based on expectations. Pressure based on the fear of failing. A fear of inferiority as ingrained into me as the preference of spicy food.
