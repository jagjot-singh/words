## Ontario


######February in Ottawa, Canada.

The sun has been setting for a couple hours now. The last of it's rays now saying farewell to our unnecessarily large and comfortable Chevy SUV that all but takes the joy out of driving fast. My partner--I will refer to him simply as B--is driving and as he cruises us down the off-ramp, a road-sign informs us we have officially entered Ottawa . The capital of Canada, where Presidents reside and Senators play. Thus the conclusion to the five hour drive from Toronto, and the start to a week of work here.

By the end end of the week we will have learnt that we are in the area of Ottawa known as St Laurent. It's all just Ottawa to us for now, as we check into the less than impresisve sleepy hotel. It's my first time in the city, and I feel the mild excitement of checking into a hotel in a new city, a conditioned response I know will soon fade. The hotel is in an industrial area, not a beautiful place, nothing strikingly ugly about it either. A place true to the iconic Canadian plain-ness and openness. A grid-like assortment of high-ceiling box-buildings that with relative ease may be converted into functional airplane hangars. Well paved double-laned roads with curious inclusions and exclusions of sidewalk at random intervals. An unfocused glance the city-scape fills my mind with an organized, functional rhythm that makes me wonder if perhaps this whole place is stamped *just a bit* too firmly onto the landscape below, which is truly visible  from the slightly elevated sections of highway.

It takes us a few minutes to have an attendant attend the front desk of the hotel, during which fatigue has been creeping in. The African man behind the desk has an accent I find hard to pay attention to. He appears upset at our intrusion into his time. I'm happy to let B do the talking and begin wandering aimlessly in the hallways. Having been put up in much worse areas in motels before, we are in no position to have any accodomation-related complaints heard. On a couple of rare occasians though, presumably due to management's failure to book something cheap at the last-minute, we had ended up in luxury hotels. The highlight having been an apartment-style suite--with a full kitchen and living room--in Hamilton. That was enough to keep us hoping every time.


My relationship to this job consists in small parts of fleeting love, and largly of a growing hatred. I despise the work and practically everything to do with it. We are salesmen in a sales campaign that has now spanned nearly a decade. From our vantage point in the field, we know that the end is in sight. We feel firsthand the hostility of a market which has become impressively saturated with an uncompetetive product. It is a commission-based job and along with our enthusiasm our pay is noticeably dwindling.

A couple months back our manager--astoundingly incompetent--had been fired, and though B should logically have been promoted to the position, it remained inexplicably vacant. We asked no questions, and waited for no answers. It was just another omen that we are the forefront of something adanboned so far behind us that it isn't worth looking. They were letting us fade out and disappear in some semblance of natural course. In addition to being technically unmanaged, our communication with the company is so sparse that we often joke whether some automated software is the only reason for us still getting contacted by head office. Of course someone has to be paying attention, for the emails keep coming, detailing the place we're going and when we were expected to get there, this information usually reaching us the night before. Hotel bookings now increasingly sent to us after we've already hit the road. There is a strange comfort to be had in being the fogotten part of a company while riding in a vehicle rented by said company.

Being back in motion and on the road is relieving, due at mostly to the fact that the day or two we spend in Toronto, I wait--I am starting to suspect B also does the same--in secrecy and anxiety for that email to set me free from my situation there. Those emails whilst comitting me to unpleasant work, also free me from the burdens of an unraveling relationship where I am both the unraveled and the unraveler. For over a year it lasted through peaks and troughs, but I intuitively understand now that the peaks have run out. Deep down, I knew it the second she stepped out of the abortion clinic and refused to look at me the entire ride home. Some foundational pieces now are the only thing keeping our relationship from crumbling into proper ruins, but with each visit back to the unbecominig home, those too weaken and strain under the weight of emotion packed into words too few to contain it. Intuitively I also understand that it is only just that I patiently and quietly suffer through the natural death of it, perhaps salvaging something of a love I cannot deny is still there.

I supress as much affection as I am able and reciprocate only to the point of equality, sticking to a path of least resistance, putting up none of my own. Each interval between jobs means opening myself up to pain I feel I deserve and have tried to prepare for by repeating to myself obsessively the mantra created out of desperation years ago, when suicide stared me in the face. Having nurtured the mantra since with unquestionng loyalty and a blind faith, I have embedded it with gratitude into the parts of me I dare not visit:

*For what I Love, I will Sacrifice.</br>*
*For what I Love, I will Suffer.*

Each visit to the dream turned nightmare is a bit colder than the last, and after each visit I look forward to escaping, even if the escape is a dream in which I am treading water fatigued, destined to drown. On the road, I can at least forget about her, letting the world's mysterious brush strokes cover me in their colorless portrait of lonlieness. A sharp, delicate and playful stroke here as I'm standing in line at the grocery store behind the gleeful couple oblivious to all except their own world. Then a thick, rough and jarring stoke there, in the familiar neighbourhood where I just briefly catch a scene framed by a well-lit window of the townhouse I'm walking by, where a tiny baby fidgets excitedly against a swollen, bared breast. Such strokes run directly over anything existing. They do not adhere to artistic gentility, and they mock wishful ambiguity.


Being fond of no one in the company, B and I vent frustration to the space inside the vehicle and attempt--at times sucessfully--humurous takes on our work situation. What aids our efforts and brings us together more than anything else though, is our shared love of Cannabis.

On this decidedly cold first night in Ottawa, as we claim our sides of the room and their respective beds, we realize that we have only about two and a half grams of flower between us. B knows a guy in Monteal, a friend way back from high-school, and Montreal is  only three hours away. It is a testament to our fondness for Marijuana that had we been talking about any other consumable here, Montreal would have been *at least three* hours away, but our openly-blind love for the plant has us decisevely nidding to *only three* hours. While we *spice*--*spicing* being a code term for smoking up--we decide that if it really comes down to it, we will drive down to Montreal, not a problem. Besides, we are already going to try and catch a concert there at the end of the week. Of course neither of us complicates the matter by acknowledging the fact that we have at most a couple of days before dankruptcy hits.


As I'm lying in bed, waiting for sleep, I tell myself I can put my head down and do this.

*Just one week here.*

*For what I love, I will sacrifice.* </br>
*For what I love, I will suffer. *



Exhausted, I fall asleep.

I've gotten to know a few of the other guests at the hotel throughout the week.

Our car was usually parked by Wayne’s room, who was living at this hotel indefinitely,
until the city found adequate housing for him and his service dog, coco.
My initial friendship was with coco, who later introduce me to Wayne. Coco sat on a cushion outside Wayne’s door. Considering the temperatures were around negative 10 I felt concern for him, but soon realized though that he was perfectly content there and would even rap on the door when he needed to drink water that would of course have frozen outside.

My interactions with coco consist of quick greeting pats in the morning before work, and playing with him for a few minutes after dinner.

By the third day as the inevitable dankruptcy looms over B and I we both want to suggest solutions but neither of us wants to be the first one to do so. Externally we stick to our routine as closely as possible, but we both know where our thoughts are. Perhaps it was pure luck, but what would happen next would later have us both discussing the plausability of the phenomenon that we attract that to us which we subconsciously and truly yearn and ask for from the world.

It's been a couple of hours. It's a weekday, and the flow of customers coming into the store is expectedly slow. B is looking something up on his phone as I notice two men walking towards the store. I perk up and brace myself to indirectly and unclearly pitch them a credit card. The store entrance is a double sliding door system. I watch them as they enter the through the first door, and pause to look at some promotional flyers put out between the two doors. They are moving without urgency, and don't seem to be in a hurry. I relax a bit and become hopeful for sale. As soon as the second sliding door opens however, before they've even fully stepped through it, I lose track of everything I had been planning for the pitch, and all I can think to do is nudge B with my elbow. I didn't need to though, as his phone was already put away, his attention was drawn by the same scent as mine. With a wicked grin he strats swinging his arm like a baseball pitcher warming up, a signal for me to step aside and let him handle it.


A few nights in, I happened to be sitting in the car outside Wayne’s door when he came up and knocked on the window. I rolled it down and he asked if I was leaving.

In truth, I had intended on just sitting there and listening to music for a bit. I had some cannabis—an indica strain that would ease me into sleep—and I was toying with the idea of smoking it as well. I told him I was not planning on going anywhere, and asked if he needed something. He was hoping I could get cigarettes for him.

I ended up driving to a nearby gas station where he bought cigarettes. He was very thankful and on the way back described a documentary he had been watching before we left. I was impressed by how passionate he seemed about the subject and people in the documentary. I was paying more attention to him than what he was actually saying so I remember little about the film itself. Terrorists, some woman from Vancouver. She may have been killed but he hadn’t yet got to the part where that was revealed.

After I drove back and he left, I sat there for a few minutes, in the darkness of the car. It was pretty late now, and it had been a long and tiring day at work. I would be restless just going to sleep then. I decided to smoke a bowl and listen to some jazz, letting my thoughts run where they please.

I was in a very pleasant mood when a pick up truck that I had seen a couple of times before parked next to me. It’s driver got out and knocked on my window. I was a bit surprised, and knew the car smelled strongly of marijuana, but I was in a pleasant mood, and didn’t worry as I opened the door.

Hello brother, how are you?

The man who looked back at me seemed of Arabic descent, perhaps Turkish. With a bit of an accent hr warmly answers me. Good good bro,! How are you? Listen bro, I was hoping you have some for me.

He pinches his thumb and forefinger together to his mouth and takes an exaggerated satisfying inhale. I nodded and said yes I could help him out. He thanked me a dozen times before I could go back into the hotel to fetch it for him.

When I came back, he was in his truck. He shook my hand warmly as I handed him a couple of buds, and looked teary eyed. He said he worked 11 hour days doing construction labour, and this was something be needed badly as he had run out a couple days ago. His friend was bringing him has but wouldn’t get there for a few days. The way he opened the bad and inhaled the smell with relief made me feel sad for him.

I knew the toll my 8 hour work days took on me, and that was without any labour. I was happy to have helped him. He tried to pay me with a fifty dollar bill. I politely declined, only to be offered a 20 dollar bill. At ten dollars I caved in, as I felt it was important to him to give back to me.

After a dozen more thank yous I wished him good night. I went to bed feeling a bit surreal, and closed my eyes.
