## Ontario


######February in Ottawa, Canada.

The sun has been setting for a couple of hours now. The last of it's rays are saying farewell to our unnecessarily large and comfortable Chevy SUV that all but takes the joy out of driving fast. My partner whom I will refer to simply as B, let's escape a yawn as he cruises us down the off-ramp.  A sign informs us we have officially entered Ottawa . The capital of Canada, where Ministers reside, and Senators play. The conclusion to a five hour drive from Toronto, and the start to a week of working here.

By the end end of the week we will have learnt that we are in the area of Ottawa called St Laurent. It's all just Ottawa to us for now, as we check into the less than impresisve sleepy-looking hotel. It's my first time in the city, and I feel the mild excitement of checking into a hotel in a new city, a conditioned response I know will soon fade. The hotel is in an industrial area, not a beautiful place, nothing strikingly ugly about it either. A place true to the iconic Canadian plain-ness and openness. A grid-like assortment of high-ceiling box-buildings that with relative ease may be converted into functional airplane hangars. Well paved double-laned roads with curious inclusions and exclusions of sidewalk at random intervals. An unfocused glance the city-scape fills my mind with an organized, functional rhythm that makes me wonder if perhaps this whole place is stamped *just a bit* too firmly onto the landscape below, which only truly becomes visible from the slight rises in some sections of the highway.

It takes us a few minutes to have an attendant attend the front desk of the hotel, during which my patience cannot cope. The African man who finally appears behind the desk has an accent I find difficult to parse. He appears upset at our intrusion into his time and makes little efort ot mask it. 

I'm happy to let B do the talking as I begin wandering aimlessly through the hallways. Having been put up in much worse areas before, we are in no position to have any accodomation-related complaints heard by our employer. On a couple of rare occasians though, presumably due to management's failure to find something cheap at the last-minute, we had ended up in luxury hotels. The highlight having been an apartment-style suite--with a full kitchen and living room--in Hamilton. That was enough to keep us hoping every time.


My relationship to this job consists in small parts of fleeting love, and largly of a growing hatred. I despise the work and practically everything to do with it. We are salesmen in a sales campaign that has now spanned nearly a decade. From our vantage point in the field, we know that the end is in sight. We feel firsthand the hostility of a market which has become impressively saturated with an uncompetetive product. It is a commission-based job and along with our enthusiasm for the work, our pay is dwindling noticeably.

A couple months back our astoundingly incompetent manager had been fired, and though B should logically have been promoted to the position, it remained inexplicably vacant. We asked no questions, and waited for no answers. It was just another omen that we are the forefront of something adanboned so far behind us that it isn't worth looking. 

They were letting us fade out and disappear in some semblance of natural course. In addition to now being technically unmanaged, our communication with the company had become so sparse that we often joked whether some automated software sending out routine emails is the only reason for us still getting contacted by head office. Of course someone has to be paying attention, for the emails keep coming, detailing the place we're going and when we were expected to get there, this information usually reaching us the night before. Hotel booking details were now increasingly sent to us after we had already hit the road. 

There is a strange comfort to be had in being the fogotten part of a company while riding in a vehicle rented by said company.

Being back in motion and on the road each trip is a relief. This relief is due mostly to the fact that the day or two we do spend in Toronto, I wait--and I am starting to suspect B also does the same--in secrecy and anxiety for that email to set me free from my situation there.

For those emails, whilst comitting me to unpleasant work, also free me from the burdens of an unraveling relationship where I am both the unraveled and the unraveler. For over a year it lasted through peaks and troughs, but I intuitively feel now that the peaks have been exhausted, and are making way for an indefnietly elongated trough.

I knew it the second she stepped out of the abortion clinic and refused to look at me the entire ride home. 

Some foundational pieces, common habits, are now the only thing keeping the relationship from crumbling into proper ruins, but with each visit back to the unbecominig home, those too weaken and strain under the weight of emotion packed into words too few to contain it. 

I also understand now that it is only just that I patiently and quietly suffer through the natural death of the thing, perhaps even salvage tiny fragments of the love I cannot deny had been there.

I supress as much affection as I am able and reciprocate only to the point of equality, sticking to a path of least resistance, while putting up none of my own. 

Each interval between jobs means opening myself up to pain I feel I'm not certain I don't deserve, and I try to prepare for it by repeating to myself obsessively the mantra I created years ago out of desperation years ago, staring suicide in the face, and have nurtured since with unquestionng loyalty and faith, embedded it with gratitude into the parts of myself I dare not visit:

*For that which I Love, I will Suffer.*
*For that which I Love, I will Sacrifice.*


Each visit to the dream turned nightmare is a bit colder than the last, and after each visit I look forward to escaping even more, even if the escape is just another dream in which I am treading water, destined to drown with fatigue. 

On the road though, I can at least forget about her.
I brace myself for the mysterious brushstrokes of a world always in the act of creation, brace myself to be painted as the colorless portrait of lonlieness I tell myself I am ready to become. 

The strokes come, some pass me by while others catch me with pinpoint accuracy.

A sharp, delicate and playful stroke here as I'm standing in line at the grocery store behind the gleeful couple oblivious to all except joy in their shared world. 

A thick, rough and jarring stoke there, later that evening in the familiar neighbourhood as I just briefly catch a scene framed in the well-lit window of the townhouse I'm walking by, where a tiny baby fidgets excitedly against a swollen, bared breast. 

Such strokes do not care for previous ones, they go right over anything existing. 

They do not adhere to artistic gentility, and they do not feel like mistakes. Where they touch me, I see what I am not. 

Being fond of no one in the company, B and I vent frustration to the space inside the vehicle and attempt humurous takes on our situation. 

What aids our efforts and brings us together more than anything else though, is our shared love of Cannabis.

On this decidedly cold first night in Ottawa, while we claim our sides of the room and their respective beds, we realize that we have only about two and a half grams of green flower between us. 

B knows a guy in Monteal, a friend way back from high-school, and Montreal is only three hours away. It is a testament to our fondness for Marijuana that had we been talking about any other consumable here, Montreal would have been *at least three* hours away, but our openly-blind love for the plant has us decisevely nodding with relief as we mouth the words *only three*. While we *spice*--*spicing* being a code term for smoking--we decide that if it really comes down to it, we will drive down to Montreal, not a problem. 

Besides, we are already going to try and catch a concert there at the end of the week. Of course neither of us complicates the matter by acknowledging the fact that we have at most a couple of days before our looming dankruptcy is actualized.


As I'm lying in bed, waiting for sleep, I tell myself I can put my head down and do this.

*Just one week here.*

*For what I love, I will sacrifice.* 
*For what I love, I will suffer. *



Exhausted, I fall asleep.

I've gotten to know a few of the other guests at the hotel throughout the week.

We usually park the car by Wayne’s room, who stays at this hotel indefinitely, until the city found adequate housing for him and his service dog, Coco.

My initial friendship was with coco, who later introduce me to Wayne. Coco sat on a cushion outside Wayne’s door. Considering the temperatures were around negative 10 degrees celcius, I felt concern, but soon realized that he was perfectly content there, and would even rap on the door when he needed to drink water, which would of course have frozen outside.

My interactions with coco consist of quick greeting-pats in the morning before work, and playing with him for a few minutes after dinner.

The inevitable depletion of our beloved bud is something B and I both want to adress, but neither of us wants to be the first one to do so. Externally we stick to our routine as closely as possible, but we read each other well enough, and now and again we catch hints of where the others mind is. 

Perhaps it was pure luck, but what would happen next would later have us discussing the plausability of the phenomenon that we do in fact attract that to us that which we subconsciously and truly yearn for, ask for from the world.

It's been a couple of hours in a shift. It is a weekday, which means the flow of customers coming into the store is expectedly slow. B and I have been disagreeing something about all morning, out of boredom, but I had stepped up my rhetoric and and challenged him to 'look it up'. It was something to do with the average life expectancy of a car in the Canadian climate, and as he consults google via his phone, I notice two men walking towards the store. 

I perk up and brace myself to indirectly and unclearly pitch them a credit card, trying to guage whether they had good or poor credit. The store entrance is a double sliding door system. I watch them enter  through the first door, then pause to look at some promotional flyers left between the two doors. They are moving without urgency, without certainty. I relax a bit as I become hopeful about a sale. 

Once the second sliding door opens however, before they've even stepped through it, I lose track of my pitch, and all I can think to do is nudge B with my elbow.

I didn't need to though, his phone already put away, his attention is drawn by the same scent as mine. With a wicked grin, he does his signature swing of the arm, like a baseball pitcher warming up, a signal for me to step aside and wait. He's got this.

The two men look understandably alarmed at being approached so powerfully a the bearded man grinning riduculously asking them what they're looking for today.

As they exchange confused glances with each other, B and I exchange winks. 

One finally mumbles " We're just ... looking... " 

"Well look no further, my friend. Look what I got here for you..."

They both take a flyer presented to them. Normally, it would be over there. Sale closed. 

But we are consumers in this situation. While B speaks to one, I pull the other one aside. 

It takes about ten minutes, but we manage to communicate our demand. 

They are surprised, but delighted. They lead us to their F-350 truck. They had just harvested their first grow. For personal use. A hundred dollars for an ounce, is by no means a reasonable price for one to make profit in Canadian cannabiz. 

But they weren't vendors, and we weren't really customers. For B and I, this was a lottery. For them, two rough-looking men in hunting attire, I think it was something of a pleasant surprise, a happy one, to know that we weren't not so different.

A few nights later, as I'm sitting alone in the car parked near Wayne’s door, he comes up and knocks on the window. I roll it down and he asks if I'm leaving.

I had intended on just sitting there and listening to music for a bit. I had some cannabis—the indica strain we purhcased from hunters—and I was toying with the idea of smoking it as well. I told him I was not planning on going anywhere, and asked if he needed something. He says he wa hoping I would get cigarettes for him.

I end up driving to a nearby gas station where he buys cigarettes. He is very thankful, and on the way back begins describing to me a documentary he had been watching when he noticed me outisde. I am impressed by how passionate he sees about the subject, and the people in the documentary. I am paying more attention to him rather than what he is actually saying, and retain little about the film itself. There were terrorists, and a woman from Vancouver. She may have been killed, but she also may not have been; he had paused at the part where that was revealed. I can feel his suspense as he tells me this, before thanking me again and going inside.

I decide sit there for a few minutes, in the relative warm darkness of the car. It was pretty late now. The day had been a long and tiring one. I feelto restless to go to sleep though. 

I decided to smoke a bowl and listen to some jazz, let my thoughts run whereever they please. 

I am in a very pleasant mood, when a pick up truck I had seen parked beside us a couple of times before, pulls in and parks right next to me. Nodding my head to the steady punches of a snare in the song titled 'Blasé' by Limes, I anticipate my first ever look at the trucks driver. 

I can make out a silouhette of man but not much more, and so intent am I on studying the figure that I barely notice it knock on my window. I am a bit surprised. I know the car smells strongly of marijuana. My mood is pleasant though, and worry isn't on my mind as I open the door and let loose a simple friendly greeting.

*Oh hi there.*

*Hello brother, how are you!?*

A man of what I guess to be Middle Eastern ethnicity is smiling merrily at me.

I find myself wondering if he is perhaps Turkish. I tell him I am fine and ask about him. I detect a bit of an accent, his tone is he warm as he answers me. 

*Good good bro!--Listen bro, I was hoping you have some for me.*

He pinches his thumb and forefinger together to his mouth and takes an exaggerated satisfying inhale. As he does this, because his movement is so precisely synced to it, I realize I hadn't turned down  music, and am glad I had not. It feels appropirate as I nod along with it, tell him yes I could help him out. 

Before I can go back into the hotel to fetch it for him, despite my assurance that it wasn't any trouble, he has already tahnked me a dozen times.

I come back out a few minutes later, and he is back his truck. He shakes my hand warmly as I hand him a couple of decently sized buds, and starts to gets teary-eyed. 

He works eleven hour days doing construction labour,  he tells me. This was something be needed badly for his back pain; he had run out a couple days ago. His friend was	 bringing him some hash, but wouldn’t get there for a few days. 

The way he gently opens the bag, inhales the smell with relief flooding his face, tugs at my heartstrings.

I knew the toll my eight-hour work days took on me, and that was without any labour. I feel happy to have helped him, and am taken back as he tries to pay me with a fifty dollar bill. 

I politely decline, only for him to offer me a twenty dollar bill next.

At ten dollars I cave and accept, I feel that it is important to him to give back something.

A few more thank yous, and we wish each other good night. 

I lock up the car, and go ask B if he's ever worked in consturction. I don't pay attention to his answer though, and head to bed feeling a bit surreal.

 As I close my eyes, I smile at the memory of the two hunters, stoned out of their minds, driving around aimlessly, looking at flyers.
