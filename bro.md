##On the brick of destruction

My brother and I are playing a game that we've devised while our parents sleep out the heat of the afternoon. The game inolves only bricks, a pile of which happens to be in a corner of our yard; left overs from a wall recently repaired. We pick up bricks, walk some distance, and throw them back towards the pile. I get a surge of adrenaline as a brick I've just sent sailing obliterates into fragments with a sharp *PING* sound, followed by my brother screeching with delight.

He is six years old, and beginning to share my fascination with the art and beauty of destruction. During the diwali past, he had thrown temper tanturms until my father finally let him light off a couple explosives, something that had made me inexplicably uncomfortable.

I imagine that the bricks are packed with explosives, and to add some credibility to my own fantasy I throw them with the intent of making them explode.

Our parents are dozing in the shade of a big open room without doors or windows, on adjacent hammock beds, about twenty meters away. They can't hear anything but two large fans working hard to push slightly cooled air at them. Between them is the empty hammock abandoned by my brother and I.

It's the middle of the day in the middle of summer in the middle of Punjab. Like all responsible parents, ours do their best to keep us resting and out of the sun during this time. And like with all children it sometimes works and we have nice long naps; more often that not though, our childish vigors and desires overpower maturity and sensibility. This being one of those times, the bricks are subject to our enthusiasm. We throw them like bowlers throw cricket balls. We throw them arcing high like soldiers tossing grenades.

My brother is darting back and forth between the brick pile and his chosen spots for throwing them. I choose to carry several warm bricks with me at a time, and try increasing my range with each throw. I am getting farther and farther from his positions.

We are wearing nothing but shorts and sandals, and even so we must occasionaly resort to the shade of nearby neem trees to let our bodies cool off and catch our breath. We're both panting as my brother squats next to me under a tree, and as his cooling wet shoulder brushes mine, I get a sudden urge to touch my head to his shoulder. It feels good as my black hair instantly lose some heat, even if at his expense. He expresses his sudden displeasure by lowering his shoulder into my chest, shoving me hard. Now in play mode, I grab him by the torso and begin tickling and swinging him around as he tries to resist while struggling with the giggles.

Soon we're throwing bricks again. I'm confident in my ability to throw and land a brick onto the pile, so I venture even further away to test my limits. I imagine the brick is an explosive cricket ball as my feet shuffle on the spot, shifting the brick gently from one hand to the other. My eyes are closed as I picture bright white wickets standing where I know the pile to be. Eyes still closed, my feet start moving into a slow run. The weight and texture of the brick feels right in my hand, beckonging to be launched. At the final step I open my eyes, lean forward, and launch the brick at the imaginary wickets.

Everything slows down. The brick is sailing towards the pile in a lovely arc, but something feels very wrong. I suddenly notice my brother in the background, his back turned to me. My gut muscles are tightened by invisible clamps as the brick begins descending. I shut my eyes as hard as I can. I hear the *THUD* as it bounces off his skull. The sound which can be produced only by a blunt object colliding with a human skull with a force much higher than what the bones of the cranium can absorb.

A suffocating lump is welling up somewhere between my chest and throat as terror rushes into me.

I run over to his thrasing body. His legs kick frantically and his arms reach behind his neck, as if attempting to push his head down into his chest. I can see blood starting to drip through his hands, and his screams become louder as his fingers turn redder.
