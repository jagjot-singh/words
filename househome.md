## Houses and homes

I met J a few a days after coming to Canada, an event merely exciting then, and one that I'm increasingly grateful for with the passing of years.

His family lived in the same west-coast Canadian suburb, on the same side of the same street as my guardian. About a dozen houses east. Less than a hundred steps. I could run there in under a minute.

J's house looked like most houses on the street, like most of the houses in the country, I'd later realize. Two-storied, rectangular, sandwiched between symmetrical back and front yards. Both yards used exclusively to supply the nation-wide not-for-profit industry of home-grown grass. Grass which is ritually harvested, packaged, and then offered to grazing herds of slow-moving green trucks. With amazement I watched the professional feeders, clinging expertly with a single wiry arm, their other hand cerimoniously tossing grass packages into the truck's gaping mechanical jaw.

On my way to developing a Canadian-ness in my subconscious, before even having had exposure to the Canadian art of apology, perhaps the first heuristic my subconscious consumed was: 

  *Spare pieces of land surrounding a house shall grow grass*. 
   
 Even house-owners who couldn't or wouldn't partake in the harvest, would actually pay others( even children!) to harvest it on their behalf, and even lend them the tools to do so.

My new Canadian house though, was member of a visibile minority among Canadian houses. It grew hard rocks in the front, more rocks and a couple of trees in the backyard. 

Making the occasional offerring of bundles of weeds, with a few branches and twigs thrown in, my new housed did not attract very many trucks with the scent of freshly cut grass on those days the rest of the houses street were saturated with it. 

I'd soon pick up on other, more subtle differences between my house and J's. If 'home' can be agreed upon as a subjective feeling a person may or may not experience towards a given house, then the distance between our houses was continents apart. 

His house feeling much more like the home I had left behind; my house, a house.

Besides J, his family consisted of two older brothers, and two parents. His mother worked two jobs, I would hear her telling J routinely. She sometimes came home early enough to cook dinner. I liked the way she wasn't shy with salt and spice, like my mother. In the mornings, she was gone before anyone was awake. 

Sometimes when she did come home early, as J and I played video games, she woud make us pause to play another game with me, one that made J roll his eyes and say 'mom' really slowly. 

She'd ask me to pick numbers for what I would only later learn was something called the Lotto 6/49. 

I alway tried hard, closing my eyes, I'd take what I felt to be the appropriate amount of time, slowly stating what felt to me the best numbers on that day. She would fill in those numbers as they came out of my mouth. 

I didn't dare tell her the truth: that I didn't actually know what I was dong. The rules of her game, the objectives, I knew none of it. Her eyes were too wide and too kind for me to say so. 

J always ignored me in my sturggle to summon the right numbers, sometimes even telling me to ignore her, which she would ignore, keeping her eyes staying focused on me.  Eyes which were too kind to ignore. 

I must have played that game about once a week, my own dishonest eyes always closed as the uncertain numbers spilled out, hoping that this time would be the time that she would win, more ready each time for her to confront me about not knowing what I was doing. 

J's father rarely spoke to his family, never to me, and could occasinally be seen in the evenings. Those evenings came at the end of the days he had finished work early at their farm on the outskirts of the city. On those days J would become suddenly reserved and quiet, out of some mixture of fear and respect that I supposed was expected of him. 

J's eldest brother was well into his twenties at that time, and was usually away for days, sometimes weeks at a time. When he was home we would carefully watch and track his every action, every movement, until he got visibily annoyed and told us to go play outside, or disappeared himself. I never asked where, and J never explained.

The middle brother was a quiet and introverted fellow with some unclear learning disability, and sporadic bursts of mania here and there. Two years older than J and I, both ten, he was not particularily confident nor bright, and thus naturally became subject to our influence, and even approval. 

To his credit, he often surpassed our expectations in challenges we playfully set for him. To our delight, our pestering demands for him to prove his worth through ridiculous feats, such as describing the taste of beer from a can we had stolen from the eldest brother's room, were inexplicably important to him; he really did try, drank that beer until he gagged, which informed us of it's taste much more eloquently than he could have with words. 

To our credit perhaps, there were also times when he simply had had enough of us, and would lose his temper. It was after such occasions that, during J and I's combined effort at an actue generousity, to get back on his good side, their house felt the most like home.

My own brother now seemingly worlds and planets away, though terrestrial land and water seperated us, was an emotionally volatile creature. Being around J and his brother I would periodically have the familiar fearful feeling of having unintentionally pushed someone to their emotional limits. Such incidents would naturally be followed by an also familiar, guilt-driven consolation on my part, only now I wasn't alone in this experience. 

J was in the same boat here, and he even bore the brunt of the most extreme outbursts from his brother, who felt close enough to me to show me his unfiltered rage, but thankfully not close enough to direct it exclusively at me. And just like my brother, J's brother gained bursts of superhuman strength and a feline unpredictability during his fits. 

Unlike my scrawny and wiry brother though, whose clinging attacks were geared to allow his teeth and nails to puncture my skin, J's much bigger, and much rounder brother simply wished to club us to death.

During the outburst,s J and I would have no choice but to mindfully grapple his strong flailing limbs, at times taking turns, to the point of a collective exhuastion which preceeded negotations.

The negotiations often concluded in him being allowed a ride on J's blue BMX, or my eventual yellow one, sometimes even both, depending on the severity of his reaction and our fear of it. Both bikes, like anything he saw as mine or J's, were shamelessly coveted by him.

We developed comradarie right away, and in a few weeks, became inseperably good friends.

So that first Canadian summer, before beginning fifth grade, my daily routine started with waking up, and as soon as I was not being accounted for, running home to J's house, where his parents would be at work, where I had a familiar freedom, and where J would still be sleeping.

J invariably stayed up late playing video games and watching television, activities which were strictly rationed luxuries in my new house. Usually being more refreshed, I became his wake up call, prompting him to make chai. Then we would scheme about the day whislt drinking chai, me being secretly jealous that I couldn't make chai that tasted good. Thus the days began, and effectively ended at curfew, which I pushed as far as I could, but quickly learned to be unnegotiable.

Post-curfew, if lucky, I'd get to watch television or play video games. If unlucky I'd be assigned chores, or made to study material which failed to capture my attention. If very unlucky, I would be studying my feet while being scolded for something I'd have to pretend to understand to make the scolding stop. When in a limbo state somewhere between lucky and unlucky, I began escaping into reading and drawing. Time outside the house, something which I had taken for granted up until then, suddenly became very precious.

Initially, J and I's activites were limited to biking and exploring. I had a to lot to learn, he had a lot to show me. I naturally fell in love with BMX bikes, and after a few months of pleading my case, was able to acquire my own. My bicycle in Punjab had been an adult's road bike, functional, designed purely for commutte. A BMX entices the rider to play, and with J bringing me up to speed on play-riding, I was soon jumping over things, skidding, sliding, both of us continually trying to one-up the other, until one of us got hurt or "shook".

"Yo you shook?"

"Nah man I ain't shook"

Always meant someone was, and not always the person being asked.

The more we explored our limits, the more confident and daring we became. Perhaps the first game we created out of what can only honestly be described as sheer mischief, was our version of golf, *golfing* as we called it. Golfing began with us *borrowing* golf clubs, me from my guardian uncle, he from his absent eldest brother's unused set. Then we would walk over to the high school field tucked behind the church and parking lot, spanning nearly the length of our street, on the opposite side of our houses.

The duration of the game was often decided by the cranky caretaker who lived in his tiny house on the far side of the fields. When he was around, he never missed an opportunity to come out yelling and pursue us, before casually collecting the golf balls that we'd sent flying and bouncing in his general direction. 

Though we rarely managed to land one within ten meters of his house, it was a something of a dream of ours, something we fancied ourselves to be progressing towards, to send one flying in through one of his windows, smashing the glass to pieces. 

The game went on like this that whole summer. We showed up swinging, he came out cursing, and we took off taunting. Sometimes we'd be at it again the very next day, with a heaping bucket of brand new balls that J always had refilled when I got to his house. 

I didn't ask; he didn't explain.

There was also much time spent by us into developing constructive skills, like the performing of often unnecessary repairs on ours bicycles, sometimes even on those of trusting family and friends.

J's mechanical aptitude was immediately apparent to me, and I was continually struck by his ability to not only diagnose mechanincal problems, but also to tinker with and seemingly create things at will.  He made it look like art. 

Sharing this interest but having nowhere near his skill, I felt educated by just watching how he did things, trying to see things the way I reasoned he must have seen them.

There had been signs throughout the summer, but it wasn't until aferward when school officialy started, that I realized J was severely lacking aptitude in both reading and writing. From having spent so much time spent around him, it was intuitively apparent to me that his difficulty largely had to do with his lack of interest in it. This of course translated into lack of practice. The matter was perhaps further excarbated by his parent's inablity to prevent him from only doing things that he found enjoyable. 

So it was that when school began, despite being the same age, in the same small elementary school, and expecting fully to be sitting together, J was a year behind. 

We were in different classrooms. Different grades.

I felt confused and pained by an injustice to which I felt I was the only witness. I began developing anger towards J, seeing that the wise-cracking confidence with which he took apart and put machines together, beat high-scores in video games, made remarkably good chai every morning, was entirely absent from the domain of letters, words, and paper. 

The same boy whom I had helped to labourously pull out an abandoned, mutilated golf cart from a ditch, with whom I had struggled to drag it home and had watched mesmerized as he turned it into a functional go-kart within two weeks using lawnmower and bicycle parts, that same kid is not seen fit to sit in a fifth grade classroom with me. 

I, an immigrant trying already to understand this new culture, this language, and this country, am feeling the true weight of a world in which I must somehow undertand this as well. 

While at school, even when we ran into each other during recess, we didn't talk much.

*S'up?* 

*You shook?*
