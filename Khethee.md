The sickle's handle is starting to feel wet. The serrated edge or the curved blade, is coated unevenly in bright to dark greens. bright green  My grip is losing it's confidence. The right hand, along with the entire arm, and eve the shoulder now that I think about it, are hopelessly tired. I wipe the greenness of the handle onto my clean brown shorts, giving myself dark a few dark brown stripes, being careful not to cut myself, but not so careful that I prevent a few teeth from catching and pulling a few small dots, in an orderly line. I am intrigued by the line of dots and it's symmetry. Having had up to a second grade education in mathematics, and having never heard the term *Fibonacci Sequence*, and having no concept of the word 'paradox', my mind sees only something which is so acutely strange because it is so casually familiar. Had I seen this pattern of dots on any man-made object it would'nt have been the least bit strange. But out here, surrounded by nothing but green stalks of [crop word], it is shocking.

I try a few times, all unsuccessfully, to recreate the exact movement that had resulted in the original abrasion. A few skin deep cuts later I give up and suddenly find myself dreading my mother's reaction.

I shift the sickle to the left hand and resume the rhythmic hacking and slashing. I am frustrated, and I try to escape from the pain into the green stalks in front of me.

I have no mental concepts of rhythm nor algorithms, but I know to find comfort in something akin to it.

Simple instructions, simple steps. Repeated over and over. And magic happens. Somehow despite consistent and considerate amounts of effort, no two strokes are ever experientally the same.

Right hand reaches to hook two stalks, settling usually for just one, but please not none.

Right hand tightens, a stroke from the sickle can be anywhere between   slicing and hacking   but *never* outside.

Nothing fell  cut   again     ;
 something  fell   ,     let it,        start again;

Repeat  Repeat   Repeat . .  .   .     .        .



The repeating usually stopping at exhaustion (rarely at things strangley familiar).


After only a minute, the left side now is give up again, for perhaps the dozenth time this afternoon. I finally stand up from my squatting position to stretch my legs. As attention drifts back to my surroundings, I'm suddenly conscious of the narrowness of the hole which I have been cutting into the crop. Turning around I see only more the same dark greenness, and become alarmed.

I remind myself that this happened before, and try not to panic. I must have been cutting at a slight angle again. But not being able to see the exit to the rest of the world, the entrance to my custom alley into it, I'm suddenly wary of the silence and snakes. I hurriedly collect as much of the cut stalks as I can carry and begin retreating from the narrow lane which has suddenly been claimed by the world I am afraid of. It is only about 10 meters before I enter the bareness part of the field, where the white cloth is laid out.

The cloth is covered by a pile that is already up to my chest. I throw my own loot on top, and vauling onto the pile, jump and fall on it a couple times, compressing it down, then repeat few more times for the enjoyable feeling. Tired and hungry, now wishing to be at home, I lie down clutching the pile awkwarldy, the tension below threatning to rise up unexpectedly and watch Bhapa, who is cutting the same way he always cuts.

Moving laterally across his wide valley, he digs ever so slighlty in at one end, and then sweeps across to the other side eating into the green while maintaining the same depth as the entry point. Despite always starting out alongside him with the intention of helping with his valley, I always end up digging myself into deep rounded holes which I enjoy. Sometimes multiple ones reflecting the times Bhapa called me out to start again. He no longer corrects me though, and I no longer complain about heat, fatigue or hunger.
