When I wake up the world has lost all it's color, and the silence has a weight to it.
 
 I don't know what I'm waking up from, or where I am. 

I'm in a bed. It's a hospital bed. Yes, we had stopped by the hospital, we were going to the circus. 

But I cannot look forward to the circus at this moment, for a sense of nausea is quickly rising, and nothing makes sense. 

The silence is so heavy. 

I try to make a sound, but my throat, along with the muscles of my abdomen, which feel strained and bruised, clench hard, as if in warning, telling me to shut up. Keep still.

The shock of a trauma it has already gone through but I am only begenning to gain conscious awareness of now. 

At the awareness of an unnatural tension in and around my groin, the nausea threatens to surface, a stronger warning this time. I dare not move my head.

My hands do not heed the warning though. Intinctively, they explore, and as soon as they start, right beneath the bandaged area they touch, jolts of pain are sent to the rest of my body. 

I want to scream, but as I manage to tilt my head to the side, vomit escapes me instead. 

Nurses are here. The sobs merge into the dry heaves. I feel hands on me.

They are done with me. I want to know what was done to me. But I cannot ask. I cannot speak.

With short breaks during which I rinse my mouth with water and take pills meant to help with nausea, I continue throwing up for several hours. 

I do not speak for the rest of that day. I do not ask questions. 

For weeks, I sit on a stool, naked wasit-down, a tub of iodine mixed with warm water in front of me. When anyone approaches, I tell them to go away. They give me my space, and I give them silence. 

I gently bathe the wound I do not have to courage to directly look at, but I can feel the pain, and see the blood on my hands. I try to wash away both. 

I like it when it's sunny. The pain seems less when it's sunny, with a bit of a breeze.
 
Eyes closed, my hands wash the hurt, tenderly, carefully, making peace with the unknown.

Every couple of days, a doctor comes at looks at me while I look awayt. He changes the dressing. I say nothing. It becomes less painful each time, never more than the day that my father had lied to me about a circus, and had taken me to a hospital instead, for something I still do not understand. Do not want to understand. 

It would be a few more years before I'd ever hear the name of the procedure, after the wound had healed, was no longer fresh, after I had changed countries. Even after understanding it, the word 'circumcision' would forever fail to create a connection to my experience, the vivid memory, bitterly left behind, undescribed.
