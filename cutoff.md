I wake up feeling that the world has lost it's color. There is a weighted, mysterious silence in the room.
 
 I cannot recall what I am waking up from, nor where I am. 

In a bed, yes. It's a hospital bed. 

Hospital. I remember now. 

We had stopped by the hospital, on our way to the circus. But that felt like a long time ago, like it had happened the day before.

I remember that I had asked my father if there would be elephants. 

I think it must have been yesterday ...

He had quickly assured me that there would be elephants.

I cannot look forward to the circus at this moment though, as I feel nauseated.

Something feels so heavy. Nothing feels right. I don't know what's wrong.

I try to make a sound, any sound, just for the sake of it, but right away my throat and abdomen clench hard.

 A firm warning by the body, directed at me, the doer, doing things to it. 

 Telling me to keep silent, not move. 
 
 Quiet. Still.

The muscles in my abdomen feel unfamiliar, strained, as if they've been bruised.

The shock is of a trauma the body has been through, has memory of, but the mind only starting to gain a fuzzy awareness of. 

I slowly gain awareness of an unnatural, swollen tension in my groin, and the nausea threatens to breach the surface. An even stronger warning now, and I know something is wrong there. I dare not lift my head. I dare not make a sound. Anything to keep the nausea at bay. 

Hands often cannot heed warnings though, and mine intinctively reach to explore. As soon as they start, right beneath the sticky wetness on a bandage where they touch, sharp , electric, pain spasms get unleashed outwards, screaming at and alongside the rest of the body. 

I want to scream too, but I barely manage to tilt my head sideways before I begin vomitting, loudly. 

Some people come, then some go.  I canot hear what they are saying over my sobs merging into dry heaves. 

Kind hands caress my head.

They are done with me, I know. I will be going home, I know.

I want to know much about what exactly had been done, but for now I cannot ask anyone; I cannot even speak.

Taking short breaks during which I rinse my mouth and take pills meant to help with nausea, I continue throwing up for several more hours. 

I do not speak for the rest of that day. I do not ask questions. 

For weeks afterwards, I sit on a stool, naked from the waist-down, a plastic tub of iodine mixed with warm water in front of me. This is to help me heal, they tell me. Whenever someone approaches, which they inevitably try for days, I quickly ask them to leave. To reaffirm my words, I go thorugh the pain of moving my healing station several times, tub, stool, bruised pride and all. Farther and farther away from the defacto area of congregation near the kitchen, farther into the vacant space of the yard. 

The message is recieved. They begin making efforts to give me space, and I carry on sitting in an effortless silence. 

All my effort goes into gently bathing a wound I cannot muster the courage to directly look at, but I can feel the pain, and I can see the blood it leaves on my hands. I try to wash it all away. 

When it's sunny, with a bit of a breeze, the pain seems much farther away than it actually is. I hear voices of friends playing nearby on those days, and even manage to smile, secretly. 
 
Eyes closed, hands touching hurt, tenderly, carefully, making peace with the unknown.

Now and again, a doctor comes at looks at me looking away. He changes the dressing. I say nothing. 

He aks me how I feel every time. It probably hurts less he figures. I nod, but  I say nothing. 

It did hurt less every day. Never more than the day that my father had told me about a circus, but then we'd had to stop off at the hospital do something, something I still do not understand, do not want to understand. 

It will be a few years before I will ever hear the name of the procedure, too long after the wound had healed, after I've changed countries, for me to relate to it. 

And though I will come to an understanding of it, the word 'circumcision' will forever fail to relatable to me. 

My memory of the experience will remain vivid; and I will to carry it in a quiet solitude, undescribed. 

It will be more than a decade later, before I can put it into words.
